<h4>Transcriber's Notes:</h4>
<p>The use of chapter, section, and page headers in this book was
inconsistent. There are two chapters titled "Public Buildings" (starting
P. 86 and P. 127). The chapters "Public Squares" (P. 181) and
"Excursions" (P. 199) switched from a titled paragraph format used in
the rest of the book to small cap beginnings for paragraphs (retained).</p>

<p>In some cases, there were changes in topics with no corresponding
change in section headings. To mark these topic changes, the
transcriber placed additional thought breaks, not present in the
original, at the following locations: P. 137 (Hotels); P. 144 (Works,
Armories, Fire Department); P. 157 (Exchanges); and P. 169
(Galleries).</p>

<p>The abbreviation "do" (used primarily in the index and routing
tables) means "ditto."</p>

<p>The Table of Contents at the beginning has been added by the transcriber;
it was not present in the original.</p>

<p>Remaining transcriber's notes are at the end of the text.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>To the stranger visiting New Orleans, and to those abroad who may feel
an interest in the metropolis of the great South-West, no apology may be
urged for the present work. Curiosity, in the one case, and necessity,
in the other, will prove a sufficient plea, and prepare the way for that
favorable reception, which it has been the aim of the publisher it
should deserve. And, judging from the interest he has taken in compiling
it, he flatters himself it will be found a communicative and agreeable
companion to both the above classes of readers, and to the public in
general.</p>

<p>The tables and index have been prepared with great care, and will be
found highly convenient to those who wish to consult the work with
reference to any particular subject of which it treats. All such
subjects are there so arranged and classified, that the reader may see,
at a glance, where they are to be found.</p>

<p>The engravings were executed by Messrs. Shields &amp; Hammond, after
original drawings, made expressly for this work, by Mr. Cowell. The plan
of the city was engraved by the same artists, after an original draught
by Mr. Mullhausen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>To several gentlemen, who have kindly aided the publisher in gathering
materials for the work, he would here express his grateful
acknowledgements. For the historical facts embodied in the volume, he is
indebted to several works on the history of Louisiana, and the discovery
and early settlement of our country.</p>

</div>


<p>Louisiana is the name given by the French, to all that extensive tract
of land, lying West of the Mississippi River, which was ceded by them to
the United States in 1803. The line of its western boundary follows the
Sabine River to the 32d degree of north latitude; thence, due north to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Red River; along that stream westerly to the meridian of 100 west
longitude; thence due north to the Arkansas River, ascending that to its
source; thence due north to the 42d degree of latitude; and along that,
parallel to the Pacific Ocean. Its northern boundary is a matter of
dispute between the United States and Great Britain, and the discussion,
at the present moment is somewhat exciting and ominous. It is the only
question in relation to any part of our border, which has not been
amicably adjusted by treaty. <i>We</i> claim the boundary formed by a line
drawn from the Lake of the Woods, in the 49th degree of latitude, due
west to the Rocky Mountains, thence to the parallel of 54, and on that
to the Pacific. The British, on the other hand, claim that part, lying
west of the Rocky Mountains, and north of the 46th parallel, or the
latitude of the Columbia River. Our claim to the whole of this
Territory, the part in dispute being called the Oregon, is based upon
priority of discovery, and purchase. The British claim the northern
portion by right of possession. The question has been held in suspense
for several years, under a treaty of joint occupancy, which is now about
to terminate. The question of ownership and jurisdiction, will probably
be adjusted definitely in the course of a few years. We trust it may be
done without the necessity of an appeal to arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The vast domain, included within the above named boundaries, contains
more than twelve hundred thousand square miles. It is about six times
the size of France, and nearly twice as large as the whole territory
embraced in the thirteen original States of the Union&mdash;an empire, in
itself sufficiently extensive to satisfy the ambition of any ordinary
people.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Columbus, and his immediate successors, were confined
to the islands in and about the Gulf of Mexico, and a part of the
adjacent coast of the two Continents. The immense tracts that lay
inland, stretching thousands of miles towards the setting sun, were
unknown and unexplored for nearly half a century after the landing of
the Europeans on this coast. Those of North America were first visited
in 1512, by Juan Ponce de Leon, a Spanish adventurer in quest of the
<span class="smcap">Fountain of Immortal Youth</span>, which the Indians represented as gushing up
in one of the Elysian Valleys of the West;&mdash;but, unfortunately for him
and for posterity, death overtook him before he reached the <i>Fountain</i>,
and the directions for finding it perished with him. Having made the
first land on Pascha <i>Florida</i>, or Palm Sunday, he gave the name of
Florida to all the country lying to the North and West.</p>

<p>In consequence of the premature death of Ponce de Leon, the expedition
was given up, and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> more was known of these regions until 1538,
when Hernandez de Soto, having been made Governor of Cuba, and
Adelantado of Florida, undertook, with a company of six hundred men, to
explore these his western dominions. He penetrated Florida, Georgia,
Tennessee and Kentucky, and struck the Mississippi not far from the
place now known as the Chickasaw Bluffs. Thence he passed over to the
Red River, and descending that, had nearly reached its mouth, when he
was seized with a sudden fever, and died. To prevent his body from
falling into the hands of the Indians, it was sunk in the stream at the
mouth of Red River, near its junction with "<i>the father of waters</i>."</p>

<p>The expedition of de Soto consumed four years, during which, his
adventures, among the various tribes and nations then teeming in these
quiet regions, were diversified and full of the most romantic interest.
He was succeeded in 1542 by Lewis de Moscoso, or Mucoso, who, with none
of the address or enterprise of de Soto, found himself and his small
company, now reduced by disease and constant warfare with the natives,
to about three hundred men, encompassed with difficulty, and in danger
of being entirely cut off. They built seven brigantines, probably the
first specimens of scientific ship building on the Mississippi, and then
dropped down the river. Pursued by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> thousands of exasperated Indians in
their canoes, harrassed, wounded, and some of them slain, the miserable
remnant at length found their way out of the river, about the middle of
July.</p>

<p>No sooner had they put to sea, than a violent tempest arose; when
another calamity befell them, which will be feelingly understood by many
of the navigators of these waters, in our own day. I will give it in the
language of the historian, who was one of the party. "While they were in
this tempest, in great fear of being cast away, they endured an
intolerable torment of an infinite swarm of musketoes, which fell upon
them, which, as soon as they had stung the flesh, it so infected it, as
though they had been venomous. In the morning, the sea was assuaged, and
the wind slacked, but not the musketoes; for the sails, which were
white, seemed black with them in the morning. Those which rowed, unless
others kept them away, were not able to row. Having passed the fear and
danger of the storm, beholding the deformities of their faces, and the
blows which they gave themselves to drive them away, one of them laughed
at another."</p>

<p>It is manifest from the narrative of de Soto's expedition, that a dense
population once covered this whole territory. It is equally manifest
that they were a race infinitely superior to the almost exterminated
tribes which still remain. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> arts of what we term civilization, in
the comforts and conveniences of social life, in the organization of
society, in works of taste, in a knowledge of the principles, and an
appreciation of the beauties of architecture, and in the application of
the various mechanical powers requisite to the construction of buildings
on a grand and magnificent scale, they may challenge comparison with
some of the proudest nations of antiquity, in the old world. What has
become of those mysterious nations, we are at a loss to conjecture; but
their works remain, though in ruins, eternal monuments of their genius
and power. As far as they have been explored, they afford ample evidence
that the appellation "New World" is an entire misnomer. As the eloquent
Mr. Wirt once said&mdash;"<i>This is the old World</i>," and the day may come,
when the antiquarian will find as much that is attractive and
interesting in the time hallowed ruins and the almost buried cities, of
America, as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum, of Thebes and Palmyra.</p>

<p>Changed as the whole country has been, in the lapse of three centuries,
in respect to most of those things which must have struck the original
discoverers with wonder, admiration, and awe&mdash;there is one feature, as
described by de Soto, that still remains, so distinct and
characteristic, that, if the brave old Adelantado should suddenly rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
from his watery grave, he would immediately recognize the place of his
burial.</p>

<p>The Mississippi is still the same as when those bold adventurers first
beheld it. The historian describes it as "a river so broad, that if a
man stood still on the other side, it could not be discerned whether he
was a man or no. The channel was very deep, the current strong, the
water muddy and filled with floating trees."</p>

<p>Of all the great rivers of this continent, it is a distinction which is
probably peculiar to the Mississippi, that it was discovered, not by
navigators entering it from the ocean, but by a band of adventurous
explorers, striking it in their march, at some thousand miles from its
mouth!</p>

<p>For more than a century after the expedition of de Soto, these mighty
regions were suffered to remain in the quiet possession of their
original owners, undisturbed by the visits of white men. In 1654, the
adventurous Col. Woods, from the infant colony of Virginia, wandered
into these then remote regions, and crossed "the great river," after
which it lay forgotten for twenty years longer.</p>

<p>In 1673, Marquette, a French monk, and Joliet, a trader, starting from
Quebec, traversed the great northern Lakes, ascended the Fox River to
its source, made a small portage west to the Wisconsin, and descended
that river to the Mississippi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> where they arrived on the 7th of July.
Committing themselves to the current, the two solitary travellers
reached a village of the Illinois, near the mouth of the Missouri, where
they were kindly received and hospitably entertained. After a brief
stay, they proceeded down to a settlement of the Arkansas, near the
river of that name. They did not proceed farther at this time, but
returned to Quebec, by the same route, fully impressed with the belief
that they could reach the Gulf of Mexico, by continuing their course on
the great river. There was immense rejoicing in Quebec at the result of
this adventure. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te deum</i> was sung in the Churches, on the occasion, and
the great Western Valley set down as belonging to France by right of
discovery. They were little aware how brief their dominion in that land
would be, or how soon the fruits of all their toils would fall into the
hands of a nation then unborn, that in one little century, should leap
to independence and power, and claim an honorable place among the hoary
empires of the earth.</p>

<p>Six years after the return of Marquette and Joliet, Robert, Chevalier de
la Salle, commenced operations for a further exploration of the
Mississippi. With seventeen men, he proceeded to the Little Miami, near
the mouth of which he built a fort. From thence he traversed the
country, till he came to the Falls of St. Anthony. Descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> the
Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, he returned by land to Quebec during
the year 1681. He then proceeded to France, procured a vessel, and
sailed in 1685, with the intention of entering the river through the
Gulf, but was unable to find its mouth.</p>

<p>In his next voyage, having met with the same disappointment, he erected
a fort in the Bay of St. Bernard, near the mouth of the Colorado.
Ascending that river, about sixteen miles, he established another fort,
which, however, he soon destroyed, and returned to the first settlement.
Here he built houses, erected another fort, which he called St. Louis,
and prepared the ground for cultivation. He made many abortive attempts
to find the entrance to the Mississippi. At length, a conspiracy was
formed among his own party, and he was cruelly murdered by Dehault, on
the 19th of March, 1687, near the western branch of Trinity River. Thus
fell, in the midst of his toils, and in the prime of his years, by the
hand of an assassin, one of the most renowned adventurers of the 17th
century&mdash;a man who may be justly claimed as an honor to the country that
gave him birth. He deserved a better fate. In cool courage, in hardy
enterprise, and in fertility of resources, he was second only to
Columbus. And in the power of subduing the wild spirits of his men, and
bending all their energies to the one object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> before him, he displayed
much of the sagacity and tact of that great navigator. In vigor,
decision and promptitude, he much resembled the renowned Cortes, without
any of the bigotry or cruelty, that tarnished the reputation of the
Conqueror of Mexico.</p>

<p>In 1699, eighteen years after La Salle had demonstrated the connection
of the Mississippi with the Gulf of Mexico, by passing out at its mouth,
Iberville succeeded in entering it from the Gulf. Ascending as far as
the junction of Red River, he returned, and proceeded, by way of the
Gulf, into Lake Pontchartrain. He formed a settlement and erected a
fort, at Biloxi, which he left under the command of his brother
Bienville, while he returned to France, to induce others to join the
colony. Soon after he left, the new commander ascended the Mississippi
as far as the present site of New Orleans. In returning, he met a
British vessel of sixteen guns, under the command of Capt. Bard, who
enquired the bearings of the great river, intimating that it was his
intention to establish a colony upon its banks. Bienville, in reply,
directed him to go farther west, and thus induced him to turn about;
from which circumstance, the place of their meeting was called "The
English Turn," a name which it retains to this day.</p>

<p>Iberville accompanied by a considerable accession of force, comprising
hardy settlers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> scientific men, soon returned to the colony.
Finding things in a promising condition, he proceeded up the river as
far as Natchez, and planted a settlement there. Leaving Bienville and
St. Denys in command, he again took leave, and sailed for France. He was
indefatigable in his exertions to establish and render permanent his
little colony. It was the first attempt in this section; and Iberville
may be well regarded as the father of Louisiana. But he did not survive
to enjoy its growth and prosperity. He died in one of the West India
Islands, a victim to the yellow fever, in 1708. About this time, one
Sauville was elected Governor. He survived the appointment, however, but
a short time. Bienville then succeeded him, and retained the office till
1710, when he was superseded by De Muys and Diron d'Artaquette.</p>

<p>Finding that they derived no immediate advantage from this new accession
of territory, the French Government, in 1712, granted to Antonio Crozat,
a rich merchant of Paris, the monopoly of the trade of Louisiana, which
he surrendered back in 1717. What a fortune a man might make now, out of
a five years monopoly of the trade of that luxuriant region!</p>

<p>In 1717, a new charter was issued, under the style of "The Western
Company," with the exclusive privilege of the trade of Louisiana for
twenty-five years. Bienville was again chosen Governor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> in the
following year, 1718, he laid the foundation of New Orleans. Hitherto
the pursuits of agriculture had been entirely neglected. Whether this
neglect was attributable to the hostility of the Indians, compelling
them to concentrate their little force in one spot, or to the flattering
promises of trade, or to the illusive hope of discovering mines of gold,
which occupied all their time, or to all these causes combined, we
cannot now determine. We only know, that, up to this period, they had
depended almost entirely upon supplies sent from France, for the common
necessaries of life. But now, the cultivation of the soil began to be an
object of considerable attention, tobacco and rice being the principal
articles from which a profit was expected.</p>

<p>The chief personage in this "Western Company," was the notorious John
Law, a Scotch financier, one of those universal speculators, who
experiment upon every thing, human and divine, who revel only in change,
and to whom mere innovation becomes the professional business of a life.
As is usual in such cases, he managed so as to draw down ruin upon
himself and his duped associates in France, while at the same time, he
had the singular tact to place the colony in a condition for the time.
The result of his schemes, however, was ultimately disastrous. The
finances of the colony were thrown into inextricable confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> The
French Ministry, instead of applying an efficient remedy, or leaving the
evil to cure itself, only tampered with it, by changing the values of
the coins, and thus deranging all the money transactions of the colony.
The effect was ruinous to some, and embarrassing to all. And when was it
otherwise? Never. History and experience utter but one voice on the
subject of governmental experiments, and arbitrary legislative
innovations, upon ordinary fiscal operations, and the course of trade.
And that voice is&mdash;"<i>hands off</i>."</p>

<p>In the mean time war was declared between France and Spain. The
colonists, sympathizing with the mother country, commenced offensive
operations against their neighbors in Florida, and took possession of
Pensacola; which, however, the Spaniards soon recovered. The trade of
war was never very profitable, even to conquerors. No sooner were the
different colonies of pale faces at loggerheads among themselves, than
their natural enemies, the Indians, began to take advantage of their
divisions, and to endeavor to exterminate them both. A horrible massacre
took place at Natchez, in 1729. This was but part of a plan which had
been formed among the Mississippi tribes, for a general butchery
throughout the colony. The Natchez tribe, mistaking the day appointed
for the sacrifice, commenced their work of blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> too soon, and thus
gave timely warning of the plot to all the other settlements. The war
which followed was a destructive one, but the Indians were ultimately
defeated.</p>

<p>Bienville, having returned to France in 1727, was succeeded by Perrier.
Under his administration, the agricultural enterprise of the colony was
considerably advanced. The cultivation of indigo was commenced in 1728.
The fig tree and the orange were introduced at the same time.</p>

<p>In 1732, ten years before the legal expiration of their monopoly, the
"Western Company" returned their charter to the King. The colony was
then scarcely more than thirty years old, yet, notwithstanding their
many and severe trials, by war and by disease, the population numbered
five thousand whites, and two thousand blacks. Bienville was, the third
time, appointed Governor, having the entire confidence both of the
government and of the people. He continued to exercise this office till
1741, when he again resigned, carrying with him into private life the
regrets and affectionate regards of the inhabitants. He was succeeded by
the Marquis de <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Vandreuil'">Vaudreuil.</ins></p>

<p>In the winter of 1747-8, the orange plantations were visited by a severe
frost, such as had never been known before, which not only cut off the
crop for the season, but almost destroyed the prospects of that branch
of business in the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The cultivation of the sugar cane, now so extensive and lucrative a
branch of business, did not begin to attract the attention of
agriculturalists till 1751. It was then introduced by the Jesuits of St.
Domingo, who sent some of the plants, as a present to their brethren in
Louisiana, accompanied by negroes, well acquainted with its cultivation,
and with the process then in use for manufacturing it into sugar. The
lower part of the Fauxbourg of St. Mary was devoted to this experiment.
That it was a happy experiment for the colony, and the country, the
waving fields and princely estates on every side, and the annually
increasing supply of this great staple, bear ample witness.</p>

<p>A large accession was made to the population of the colony in 1754, by
the arrival of emigrants from Acadia, (Nova Scotia) which they were
compelled to leave, owing to the oppressive measures of the British
Government, by which that province had just been conquered. A few years
afterwards, great numbers of Canadians, fleeing from the same
oppressions, found refuge in the sunny valleys of the south, and brought
a very considerable acquisition of strength and wealth to the colony.</p>

<p>"The seven years' war" between France and England, ended in the cession,
to the latter power, of all the French possessions in North America,
except Louisiana. It was stipulated, between the two crowns, that the
boundary line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> of their respective dominions, in the New World, should
run along the middle of the Mississippi, from its source as far as the
Iberville, and along the middle of that river, and of Lakes Maurepas and
Pontchartrain. This was in 1763. In the course of the same year,
Louisiana was transferred by treaty to the crown of Spain. The tidings
of this unexpected cession, which were not promulgated until two years
after the execution of the treaty, spread dismay through the colony. The
idea of being passed over, <i>nolens volens</i>, to the domination of
Spaniards, was revolting to the thousands of true hearted and loyal
Frenchmen, who had acquired and defended the territory, and claimed it
as their own. They resolved, as one man, to resist this unceremonious
change of masters, apparently determined, if their old mother, France,
persisted in casting them off, to set up for themselves.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this resolution, they refused to receive Don Ulloa, whom
the King of Spain despatched in 1766, to take possession of the
Province, and to assume the Government, as his representative. The point
was disputed at the cannon's mouth, but the colony prevailed, and Don
Ulloa returned with his dishonored commission, to his master. Charles
was as indignant as his crest-fallen servant, at this unexpected
repulse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> But he was too busy with his own troubles at home, to pursue
the matter at that moment.</p>

<p>A fit instrument of Royal vengeance was at length found, in the person
of Don O'Reilly, a renegade Irishman, who, in 1769, was appointed to
subdue and rule over the refractory province. A more perfect
exemplification of the remark, that the most depraved unprincipled man
may gain the confidence and regard of Kings, can scarcely be found. In
the execution of his trust, he showed himself a very fiend incarnate.
First, by fair promises, cautiously mingled with just as much of
intimidation, as would give an air of candor and courtly conciliation to
his promises, he induced the too credulous Louisianians to abandon their
purpose of resistance, and surrender without striking a blow. This
artful guise he continued to wear, till he had obtained possession of
all the insignia of government, and the sinews of power, and placed his
own chosen tools in all the chief places of trust. Then the mask of
hypocrisy was boldly thrown off, and the cloven foot uncovered. His fair
promises were immediately shown to be only a master stroke of policy, to
gain an end. In the face of his solemn stipulations, he caused those who
had been foremost in refusing submission to his authority, to be seized
and put to death. Five of them, principal citizens of New Orleans, he
caused to be publicly shot. Five more he consigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> to the dungeons of
the Moro, at Havana, and one he procured to be assassinated. Other acts
of cold-blooded cruelty, and false-hearted tyranny followed, till he
became the execration and abhorrence of the whole colony. He introduced
the Spanish colonial system, and subjected the inhabitants to every
species of indignity and abuse. At length, the extravagance of his
measures, and his unprincipled abuse of power, wrought its own ruin. He
was recalled by his King, and disgraced&mdash;if one already so infamous
could by any means be rendered more so. His successor was Unzoga, who
was shortly after superseded by Galvez.</p>

<p>The colony now enjoyed a brief season of comparative quiet. But the war
between England and Spain, which broke out in 1779, afforded an
opportunity for Governor Galvez to show his loyal zeal, and exercise his
military talents. With the troops under his command, he invaded Florida,
took possession of Baton Rouge, and Fort Charlotte, near Mobile, and
proceeded to Pensacola, which, after an obstinate resistance, also
submitted to his authority. Thus was the Spanish dominion completely
established in Florida.</p>

<p>Governor Miro, who succeeded Galvez, carried into full effect the
colonial system of Spain, which was by no means relished by the French
inhabitants of the colony.</p>

<p>In 1785, a new firebrand was thrown into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> midst of these combustible
elements. An attempt was made to establish an office of the Inquisition
in Louisiana. It was fearlessly opposed, and fortunately crushed without
bloodshed. The agent, to whom the obnoxious business was entrusted, was
seized in his bed, conveyed forcibly on board a vessel, and sent home to
Spain.</p>

<p>A census of the province, taken in 1788, just ninety years from the date
of the first settlement, showed a population of 42,611. Of these, 19,445
were whites, 21,465 slaves, and 1701 colored freemen. New Orleans, then
70 years old, contained 5,338 inhabitants.</p>

<p>The Baron de Carondelet was appointed Governor in 1792. During his
administration, in the year 1794, the first newspaper, called "Le
Moniteur," was published in Louisiana. At the same period the Canal
Carondelet was commenced; and the cultivation of indigo and the sugar
cane, which had hitherto been the great staples of the colony, was
suspended.</p>

<p>In 1795, by the treaty of St. Lorenzo, the navigation of the Mississippi
was opened to the western States of the Union, and the great impulse
given to the commercial prosperity of New Orleans, which secured forever
the pre-eminence of the Crescent City. The same treaty defined the
boundaries, as they now exist, between Florida and Mississippi. But
Carondelet, being rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> more tardy in yielding possession, than suited
the active, enterprising spirit of the Americans, the territory was
seized by an armed force, under Andrew Elliott.</p>

<p>Two years after this, a plan set on foot by Carondelet, to dismember the
American Union, by drawing the Western States into a separate compact,
was detected and defeated by the address of General Wilkinson. Whether
Aaron Burr was in the plot, or only took a hint from it a few years
later, does not appear of record. Carondelet was succeeded by Gayosa de
Lamor, Casa Calvo, and Salvado, who, successively, but for a very brief
period, wielded the chief magistracy of the colony.</p>

<p>In 1803, Louisiana was re-transferred to France, and immediately sold to
the United States for 15,000,000 of dollars. The treaty which
accomplished this important object was entered into on the 30th of
April. Possession was taken, in behalf of the United States, by General
Wilkinson and William C. Claiborne, amid the rejoicings of a people
attached to liberty, and eager to grasp at any opportunity to shake off
the yoke of Spain.</p>

<p>The population of Louisiana, at the time of the purchase, did not exceed
fifty thousand, exclusive of the Indians, and these were scattered over
every part of its immense territory. Seven years after, the population
had nearly trebled, and her prosperity had advanced in equal
proportion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1812 was a memorable era in the history of Louisiana, and
marked with incidents never to be forgotten by her citizens. It was in
this year, that the first Steam Boat was seen on the bosom of "the great
river," now alive with hundreds of these winged messengers, plying to
and fro. In the same year war was declared with Great Britain, and
Louisiana, as now constituted, was admitted, as an independent State,
into the great American Confederacy.</p>

<p>The State of Louisiana is bounded on the north by the states of
Arkansas, and Mississippi; on the east by the latter and the Gulf of
Mexico; on the south by the Gulf of Mexico, and on the west by Mexico
and Texas. It is a well watered garden, the soil being rich, and
intersected by the Mississippi, Red, and Wachita Rivers, and many
inferior streams, and washed, on its western limit, by the Sabine.</p>

<p>The face of the country is exceedingly level, so much so, that in a
portion equal to three fourths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> of the State, there is scarcely a hill
to be found. Those parts that are covered with pine woods are usually
uneven, sometimes rising into fine swells, with broad table summits,
intersected with valleys from thirty to forty feet deep. They do not lie
in any particular range, but, like the ocean in a high and regular
swell, present a uniform undulated surface. The alluvial soil is, of
course level, and the swamps, which are only inundated alluvions, are
dead flats.</p>

<p>A range of gentle elevations commences in Opelousas, and gradually
increasing in height as it advances, diverges toward the Sabine. In the
vicinity of Natchitoches, this range holds its way northwestwardly;
about half way between the Red and the Sabine Rivers, and continues to
increase in altitude, till it reaches the western border of the State.
Seen from the pine hills above Natchitoches, it has the blue outline and
general aspect of a range of mountains.</p>

<p>Another line of hills, commencing not far from Alexandria, on the
northern side of the Red River, and separating the waters of that stream
from those of the Dudgemony, extends northwardly, till it approaches,
and runs into, the mammillæ, or bluffs, that bound the alluvions of the
Wachita, diverging gradually from the line of that stream, as it passes
beyond the western limits of the State.</p>

<p>That remote part of Natchitoches called Allen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> settlement, is a high
rolling country. There are also hills of considerable magnitude on the
east side of the Mississippi, beyond the alluvions. But generally
speaking, Louisiana may be considered as one immense plain, divided into
pine woods, prairies, alluvions, swamps, and hickory and oak lands.</p>

<p>The pine-wood lands, as I have already said, are usually rolling. There
are some exceptions, but they are very few. They have almost invariably
a poor soil. Some of those west of Opelousas, and those between the
Wachita and Red Rivers, are even sterile, answering well to the name by
which they are called in some other parts of the country, Pine Barrens.</p>

<p>Some parts of the prairies of Opelousas are of great fertility, and
those of Attakapas are still more so. As a general feature, they are
more level than those of the upper country. An extensive belt of these
prairies, bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, is low and marshy, and
subject to be wholly inundated in any extraordinary swell of the river.
A considerable portion of them have a cold clayey soil, the surface of
which, under the influence of a warm sun, hardens into a stiff crust. In
other portions, the soil is of an inky blackness, and often, in the hot
and dry season, cracks in long fissures some inches in width.</p>

<p>The bottoms are generally rich, but in very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> different degrees. Those of
the Mississippi and Red Rivers, and the bayous connected with these
streams, are more fertile than those on the western border of the State.
The quality of the richer bottoms of the Mississippi, as well as those
of the Red River, is sufficiently attested by the prodigious growth of
timber in those parts, the luxuriance of the cane and the cotton, the
tangles of vines and creepers, the astonishing size of the weeds&mdash;which,
however, find it difficult to over-top the better products of the
soil&mdash;and the universal strength of the vegetation.</p>

<p>The most productive district of this State, is a belt of land, called
"<i>the Coast</i>," lying along the Mississippi, in the neighborhood of New
Orleans. It consists of that part of the bottom, or alluvion, of the
Great River, which commences with the first cultivation above the
Balize, about forty miles below the capital, and extends about one
hundred and fifty miles above it. This belt on each side of the river,
is secured from an overflow by an embankment, called "<i>the levee</i>," from
six to eight feet in height, and sufficiently broad, for the most part,
to furnish an excellent highway. The river, in an ordinary rise, would
cover the greater part of these beautiful bottoms, to a depth of from
two to six feet, if they were not thus protected. This belt is from one
to two miles in width; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> richer tract of land, of the same extent,
cannot probably be found on the face of the globe.</p>

<p>On the east side of the river the levee extends to Baton Rouge, where it
meets the highlands; on the west side, it continues, with little
interruption, to the Arkansas line. On the east, above the levee, are
the parishes of Baton Rogue and West Feliciana. This latter received its
appropriate and expressive name from its beautifully variegated surface
of fertile hills and valleys, and its rare combination of all the
qualities that are most to be desired in a planting country. It is a
region of almost fairy beauty and wealth. The soil literally teems with
the most luxuriant productions of this favored clime. The hills are
covered with laurel, and forest trees of magnificent growth and foliage,
indicating a soil of the richest and most productive character. Here are
some of the wealthiest and most intelligent planters, and the finest
plantations in the state, the region of princely taste and luxury, and
more than patriarchal hospitality. The mouth of Bayou Sara, which is the
point of shipment for this productive region, transmits immense
quantities of cotton to New Orleans. Some of the plantations on this
bayou have from five to eight hundred acres under cultivation.</p>

<p>On the western side of the Mississippi, are the Bayous Lafourche and
Plaquemine, outlets, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> arms of the Great River, and subject, of
course, to all its fluctuations. The bottoms bordering on these bayous
are of the same luxuriant soil, as those on the parent stream, and are
guarded from inundation in the same manner, by levees. In this region,
the sugar cane is exceedingly productive. It is estimated that, within a
compass of seven miles from Thibadeauxville, in the vicinity of the
Bayous Black and Terre Bonne, about one tenth of the sugar crop of
Louisiana is produced.</p>

<p>A considerable part of Attakapas is also very productive, as well as
portions of Opelousas. The latter, however, is better adapted to
grazing. The Teche, which meanders through the former, and the eastern
part of the latter, of these two parishes, never overflows its banks.
The land rises from the river, in a regularly inclined plane towards the
woods, affording free courses for the streams, which discharge
themselves into the bayou. The soil, therefore, cannot be called
alluvial, though in the most essential quality of productiveness, it is
scarcely inferior to the best of them. It is a lovely region, the most
beautiful, perhaps, in the whole Union, for agricultural purposes. But
it has one great drawback, especially for the cultivation of sugar;
there is a deficiency of ordinary fire-wood; though the live-oak abounds
there to such an extent, that Judge Porter once remarked in Congress,
that "there was enough of it in Attakapas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> to supply the navies of the
whole world with ship timber."</p>

<p>The lands on the Atchafalaya are of an excellent quality, and would
afford a desirable opening for enterprising cultivators, if they were
not liable to frequent inundations, an evil which will doubtless be
remedied, as the population and wealth of that section advances. Those
on the Courtableau, which runs through Opelousas, are equal in point of
fertility, to any in that parish. From thence, proceeding northward, by
Bayou B&oelig;uf, we find, on that bayou, a soil which is regarded by many
as the best in the State for the cultivation of cotton. There is also
land of an excellent quality on Bayou Rouge, though it is, as yet, for
the most part, in the state of nature. The banks of the Bayou Robert,
still further north, are of extraordinary fertility, the cane brake, a
sure evidence of a very rich soil, flourishing with astonishing
luxuriance. Bayou Rapid, which gives its name to the parish through
which it runs, intersects one of the most beautiful tracts in the state,
which is laid out, on both sides of the bayou, through the whole length
of its course, into the finest cotton plantations.</p>

<p>The bottoms of the Red River are well known for their fertility. Those
which lie about its lower courses are justly esteemed the paradise of
cotton planters. The soil is of a darkish red color, occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> by the
presence of the red oxide of iron. It is thought to derive its character
of luxuriant productiveness from a portion of salt intimately blended
with its constituents, which, from its tendency to effloresce in a warm
sun, renders the compound peculiarly friable. This soil is deep, and has
been accumulating for unknown ages, from the spoils of the Mexican
mountains, (a species of natural annexation which the laws of nations
have no power to regulate,) and the vast prairies which are washed by
its upper courses.</p>

<p>The rich valley of the Red River is of a magnificent breadth, and for
the most part, where it has not been cleared for cultivation, covered
with a dense growth of forest trees. All the bayous of this river, which
are very numerous, branching off in every direction, and intersecting
every part of this luxuriant valley, partake of the fertilizing
character of the main stream.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There are few things among the works of nature, more remarkable than the
<i>floating prairies</i>, which are found upon the lakes bordering upon the
coast of the Gulf. They seem to have been formed by the natural
aggregation of such vegetable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
matter as lay suspended upon the surface of the water, supplied with a
light substratum of soil, partly by its own decay and disintegration,
and partly by attracting around its roots and fibres the alluvial
treasures with which all these waters abound. From this, various kinds
of grass and weeds have sprung up, the roots of which have become firmly
interwoven with the subjacent mass, matting it completely together, and
giving it all the appearance of a substantial island. It is often
several inches in thickness, and so nearly resembles terra firma, that
not only the sagacity of man, but even animal instinct has been deceived
by it. These floating prairies are sometimes of great extent, and are by
no means confined to waters comparatively shoal. They literally cover
the deeps in some cases, and a great deal of precaution is necessary to
avoid them, for, stable as they look at a distance, they are as
unsubstantial as shadows, so that boats may oftentimes be forced through
them. They are less trustworthy than quicksands, for the unlucky wight
who should adventure himself upon their deceitful appearances, would
find himself entangled in a net of interminable extent, from which it
would be impossible to extricate himself.</p>

<p>It may not be deemed presumption, perhaps, to suggest, that the great
Raft on the Red River may be a formation upon the same principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
though upon a more enlarged scale. The stream being sluggish, and the
alluvial deposit exceedingly heavy and rich, the accumulation of a
productive soil, and the consequent growth and entanglement of roots
would be very rapid; and a foundation would ultimately be formed
sufficiently stable and permanent, to be travelled with safety. Floating
trees from the upper courses, arrested by this obstruction, would imbed
themselves in the mass, until, by continual accretions, it should become
what it now is, an impassable and almost irremovable barrier to
navigation.</p>

<p>The Delta of the Mississippi is a region of extensive marshes. For many
leagues, the lakes, inlets and sounds, which dissect and diversify that
amphibious wilderness, are connected by an inextricable tissue of
communications and passes, accessible only by small vessels and bay
craft, and impossible to be navigated except by the most experienced
pilots. It is a perfect labyrinth of waters, more difficult to unravel
than those of Crete and Lemnos. The shore is indented by numberless
small bays, or coves, few of which have sufficient depth of water, to
afford a shelter for vessels. Berwick and Barritaria Bays are the only
ones of any considerable magnitude.</p>

<p>The prairies which cover so large a portion of this State, are, for the
most part, connected together, as if the waters from which they were
originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> deposited had been an immense chain of lakes, all fed from
the same great source. And this was undoubtedly the fact. They were all
supplied from the Mississippi, and their wonderful fertility is derived
from the alluvial riches of those interminable regions, which are washed
by the father of rivers and his countless tributaries. Those included
under the general name of Attakapas, are the first which occur on the
west of the Mississippi. It is an almost immeasurable plain of grass,
extending from the Atchafalaya on the north, to the Gulf of Mexico, on
the south. Its contents are stated to be about five thousand square
miles. Being open to the Gulf, it is generally fanned by its refreshing
breezes. To the traveller in those regions, who may have been toiling on
his weary way through tangle, and swamp, and forest, there is something
indescribably agreeable in this smooth and boundless sea of unrivalled
fertility, whose dim outline mingles with the blue of the far off
Gulf&mdash;the whole vast plain covered with tall grass, waving and rippling
in the breeze, sprinkled with neat white houses, the abodes of wealth,
comfort and hospitality, and dotted with innumerable cattle and horses
grazing in the fields, or reposing here and there under the shade of the
wooded points. The sudden transition from the rank cane, the annoying
nettles, the stifling air, and the pestilent mosquitoes, to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> open
expanse, and the cool salubrious breath of the ocean, is as delightful
and reviving as an oasis in the desert.</p>

<p>In the midst of this immense prairie, is situated the parish of
Attakapas. This word, in the language of the Aborigines, from whom it is
derived, signified "man-eater," the region having been occupied by
Cannibals. Strange indeed, that the inhabitants of a climate so bland,
and a soil so fertile, should possess the taste, or feel the necessity
for so revolting and unnatural a species of barbarism.</p>

<p>Opelousas prairie is still more extensive than Attakapas, being computed
to contain nearly eight thousand square miles. It is divided by bayous,
wooded grounds, points, and bends, and other natural boundaries, into a
number of smaller prairies, which have separate names, and
characteristics more or less distinctive. Taken in its whole extent, it
is bounded by the Attakapas prairie on the east, pine woods and hill on
the north, the Sabine on the west, and the Gulf of Mexico on the south.
The soil though in many places extremely fertile, is generally less so
than that of Attakapas. It has, however, a compensating advantage, being
deemed the healthiest region in the State. It embraces several large
cotton plantations, and a considerable region devoted to the cultivation
of the sugar cane. The parish which bears its name is one of the most
populous in Louisiana. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> centre of the land of shepherds, the
very Arcadia of those who deal in domestic animals. To that employment,
the greater part of the inhabitants are devoted, and they number their
flocks and herds by thousands. On one estate five thousand calves were
branded in the spring of 1845.</p>

<p>The people of this district are distinguished for that quiet, easy,
unostentatious hospitality, which assures the visitor of his welcome,
and makes him so much at home, that he finds it difficult to realize
that he is only a guest.</p>

<p>Bellevue prairie lies partly in Opelousas, and partly in Attakapas.
Calcasieu and Sabine prairies are only parts of the great plain, those
names being given to designate some of the varied forms and openings it
assumes in its ample sweep from the Plaquemine to the Sabine. They are,
however, though but parts of a larger prairie, of immense extent. The
Sabine, seen from any point near its centre, seems, like the mid-ocean,
boundless to the view. The Calcasieu is seventy miles long, by twenty
wide. Though, for the most part, so level as to have the aspect of a
perfect plain, the surface is slightly undulated, with such a general,
though imperceptible declination towards the streams and bayous by which
it is intersected, as easily to carry off the water, and prevent those
unhealthy stagnations which are so fatal in this climate. There is also
a gentle slope towards the Gulf, along the shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> of which the vast
plain terminates in low marshes often entirely covered with the sea.
These marshes are overspread with a luxuriant growth of tall reedy cane
grass.</p>

<p>One of the most striking and peculiar features of these prairies is
found in the occasional patches of timbered land, with which their
monotonous surface is diversified and relieved. They are like islands in
the bosom of the ocean, but are for the most part so regular and
symmetrical in their forms, that one is with difficulty convinced that
they are not artificial, planted by the hand of man, in circles,
squares, or triangles, for mere ornament. It is impossible for one who
has not seen them, to conceive of the effect produced by them, rising
like towers of various forms, but each regular in itself, from the midst
of an ocean of grass. Wherever a bayou or a stream crosses the prairie,
its course is marked with a fringe of timber, the effect of which upon
the eye of the observer is exceedingly picturesque, making a background
to the view in many instances, like lines of trees in landscape
painting.</p>

<p>All the rivers, bayous, and lakes of this State abound with alligators.
On Red River, before it was navigated by steamboats, it was not uncommon
to see hundreds in a group along the banks, or covering the immense
masses of floating and stranded timber, bellowing like angry bulls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
huddled so closely together, that the smaller ones were obliged to get
upon the backs of the larger. At one period, great numbers were killed
for their skins, which were made into leather for boots and shoes, but
not proving sufficiently close grained to keep out the water, the
experiment was abandoned. Alligators average from eight to twelve feet
in length. Some have been caught, measuring twenty feet.</p>

<p>The fear is often entertained, and sometimes expressed, that the levees
of the Mississippi are not sufficient to resist the great body of water
that is continually bearing and wearing upon them; and these fears have,
in several cases, been realized, though never to any very great extent.
In May 1816 the river broke through, about nine miles above New Orleans,
destroyed several plantations, and inundated the back part of the city
to the depth of three or four feet. The crevasse was finally closed, by
sinking a vessel in the breach, for the suggestion and accomplishment of
which, the public was chiefly indebted to Governor Claiborne.</p>

<p>In June, 1844, the river rose higher than it had done for many years,
marking its whole course, for more than two thousand miles, with wide
spread destruction to property and life. It crept over the levee in some
places near New Orleans, but caused no actual breach in that vicinity.
At Bonnet Carre it forced a crevasse, doing considerable damage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
causing great alarm in the neighborhood; but the mischief was not so
serious as might have been anticipated, and the embankment has been so
increased and strengthened, as to leave but little apprehension for the
future.</p>

<p>The interests of Education in Louisiana, though hitherto too much
neglected, are now decidedly and perceptibly advancing. In the higher
departments, are the College of Louisiana, at Jackson, in East
Feliciana; and Jefferson College in St. James parish, on the coast&mdash;the
former incorporated in 1825, the later in 1831. Both have at various
times, received generous donations from the treasury of the state.
Franklin College, in Opelousas was also incorporated in 1831, under the
same favorable auspices.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p>There are also several Academies acting under the legal sanction of the
State, although not endowed by it. The Ursuline Nuns' School and that of
the Sisters of Charity&mdash;the latter in the parish of St. James, afford
instruction in all the polite branches of female education. The Convent
at Grand Coteau near Opelousas, has an average of about two hundred
scholars; and efficient persons from France have the control and
direction of their education.</p>

<p>The public schools, designed for the general and gratuitous
dissemination of knowledge among all classes, have not only increased in
number but have generally outstripped those of the higher order, by
seizing at once upon all the improvements which the experience of
teachers in other parts of the country, and the world, has from time to
time suggested. Mere innovations rather hinder than advance the progress
of education. But the simplest suggestion of an enlightened experience
and a sound judgment, such as are brought to bear upon this great
interest throughout the whole of the northern and eastern States, is
entitled to the profound regard of the Southern philanthropist, whose
aim and ambition it should be, to make the most of every facility and to
be no whit behind the older, but not more wealthy sections, in any thing
that can promote the moral and intellectual power of the masses of the
people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The climate of Louisiana is hot and moist. In the neighborhood of the
marshes, and in the summer season, it partakes of the unhealthy
character of nearly all tropical climates. Diseases of the lungs,
however, and other complaints so prevalent at the north, are scarcely
known; and to many, the quick consuming fever which finishes its work in
a few days, may be considered but a fair offset to the slow but sure
consumption, which flatters its victims with the semblance of life and
hope, while dragging them through its long and dreary labyrinths, to the
chambers of death.</p>

<p>This climate is favorable to almost all the productions of the tropics.
The sugar, the cotton plant, the orange, the lemon, the grape, the
mulberry, tobacco, rice, maize, sweet potato, &amp;c., &amp;c., flourish in rich
abundance, and some of them attain to a luxuriance of growth scarcely
known in any other part of the world. Sugar and Cotton are the two great
staples. The former is confined chiefly to that tract, which, by way of
distinction, is called "the coast," lying along the shores of the Gulf,
and the bayous of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The average sugar crop of the whole state, is now about 180,000
hogsheads. That of cotton, for the last year is not ascertained, but the
amount produced in the whole valley of the Mississippi, sent to New
Orleans for export in 1843, was 1,088,000 bales. Owing to the large
extension of the cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> growing districts, and excessive competition in
its manufacture, the cultivation of cotton yields less profit than it
formerly did, and there seems to be no substantial reason why it should
not, in some degree, give place to sugar, at least until the latter can
be furnished in sufficient quantity to supply the domestic consumption.
Under the ordinary increase of population, the utmost exertions of the
cane planters will hardly arrive at such a result, in half a century to
come.</p>

<p>While on this subject, it will not, I trust, be deemed irrelevant or
officious, to place before the reader the suggestions of an intelligent
gentleman of New Orleans, in regard to the present mode of cultivating
and manufacturing sugar. He observes that in order to carry on the
business to advantage, and compete favorably with those already
established, a large capital is required, since in addition to the
ground to be cultivated, and the hands to be employed in the field,
expensive mills and machinery must be set up, and kept in motion, with a
large number of laborers in attendance. Consequently no man in moderate
circumstances can undertake this branch of business, as it is now
conducted. To obviate this difficulty, and extend the cultivation and
manufacture of this important staple, he proposes a division of labor
and profit, like that which prevails in the grain growing and milling
regions of the north. The farmer sells his wheat, at a fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> market
value, to the miller, or pays him a stipulated percentage for grinding
and bolting. In the same manner might the business here be divided into
two distinct branches. The planter might sell his cane to the miller, or
pay him the established price for converting it into sugar and molasses.
This would enable men of comparatively small means to undertake the
cultivation of the cane, who now confine themselves to cotton, and thus
relieve the larger cultivators of the latter staple from the dangers of
over production.</p>

<p>Casting our eyes back to no very distant period, and noticing the small
beginnings of our early planters of cotton, the reader will pardon the
introduction of a trifling anecdote. During the year 1784, only sixty
years since, and therefore within the memory of many now living, an
American vessel, having <i>eighty bales</i> of cotton on board, was seized at
Liverpool, on the plea that <i>so large</i> an amount of cotton could not
have been produced in the United States. The shipment in 1785 amounted
to 14 bales, in 1786 to 6, in 1787 to 109, 1788 to 389, in 1789 to 842.
An old Carolina planter, having gathered his crop of five acres, was so
surprised and alarmed at the immense amount they yielded, which was
fifteen bales, that he exclaimed "well, well&mdash;I have done with
cotton&mdash;here is enough to make stockings for all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> people in
America!" The cotton crop of the United States for 1844 was 2,300,000
bales.</p>

<p>The fluctuations in the foreign cotton market, within a few years past,
have produced, among scientific agriculturalists and experienced
planters, no little speculation upon the course which a due regard to
their own interests requires them to pursue. It is not to be wondered
at, that in a country so vast, so luxuriantly fertile as ours, and
teeming with the most enterprising and industrious population on the
face of the earth, the strict relations of supply and demand should be
occasionally disturbed in some of the many abundant productions of the
soil. It is always a difficult problem to solve, especially where the
field is very large, and the producers many, and constantly increasing.
In attempting to meet it, the first question to be answered is, does the
present supply greatly overreach the present demand?</p>

<p>An intelligent writer in Hunt's Merchant's Magazine for October, 1844,
Henry Lee, Esq., has placed this subject, so far as he has there pursued
it, in a very clear light. He commences by stating that "the consumption
of cotton in Europe, other than the production of America and India, is
too insignificant to have any important bearing upon prices." He goes on
to show that the value placed upon the article at present, is quite
sufficient, and that the advantage it gives to the manufacturer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> of New
England, whose operations are vastly increasing, renders him a
successful competitor to those of Great Britain; and nothing but an
inflated currency, or imprudent speculations can produce an advance. And
any advance so procured must inevitably be followed by a ruinous
reaction. He shows that, through the agency of the British
manufacturers, and the exporters of their goods to countries beyond the
Cape of Good Hope, a considerable quantity of American grown cotton had
been sent to those regions, in the form of manufactures and twist, over
and above the amount of Indian grown cotton consumed in the factories of
England. This simple fact, which is demonstrated as clearly as figures
can speak, completely nullifies the importation of cotton from that
quarter.</p>

<p>The proportion of raw cotton, other than the produce of the United
States and India, used in the manufactures of Great Britain, is very
small, and constantly diminishing in quantity. After producing
statistical evidence, Mr. Lee arrives at the satisfactory result that
the consumption of cotton from the United States and India, is as
ninety-four to one hundred, leaving, for all other sources of supply,
only six per cent. With such a ratio as this, and the competition
constantly declining, it is manifest that we have nothing to fear from
rival producers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The delicate enquiry now arises, can the American planter sustain
himself under existing prices? Or, can he, by the exercise of better
economy, make his labors more productive? It seems to me, if it will not
be presuming too far to offer the suggestion, that there should be an
understanding between the larger and more intelligent planters, in
relation to these points, and that they should, for their own individual
and collective interests, consider, whether it would not be better
partially to restrain the cultivation of this staple, rather than permit
it to increase beyond the known and certain demands of commerce. The
question increases in importance, as the cotton growing region enlarges,
by the admission of "the lone star" into the constellation of Freedom.
While it secures to the United States forever almost the entire monopoly
of production, it puts it in her power, by a judicious combination among
her great producers, to command a fair compensating price for cotton.
Without some such combination, or, which is equivalent to the same
thing, a prevailing disposition on the part of the planters, rather to
wait for a demand than to anticipate, or endeavor to create it, there
will always be a surplus stock in the market, which, however
insignificant, will affect the price of the whole crop.</p>

<p>The luxuriant soil of Louisiana is capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> of producing many
articles even more lucrative than cotton, of which there is no immediate
danger of creating an over supply. For some of them, there is a very
large and increasing home consumption, as well as an active demand in
other parts of the world that are open to our commerce. Of sugar, I have
spoken already. Madder, silk, hemp, tobacco, may also be mentioned, as
promising sure results to any who are disposed to try them. Under the
impression that, in view of what I have already presented, the subject
will be interesting to my readers, I shall venture to add a few words in
relation to some of the above-mentioned articles.</p>

<p>Madder,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubia tinctorum</i>,) the roots of a plant, which consist of
several varieties. They are long and slender; varying from the thickness
of a goose quill, to that of the little finger. They are
semi-transparent, of a reddish color, have a strong smell, and a smooth
bark. Madder is very extensively used in dying red; and, though the
color which it imparts be less bright and beautiful than that of
cochineal, it has the advantage of being cheaper and more durable. It is
a native of the south of Europe, Asia Minor, and India; but has long
since been introduced into,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and successfully cultivated in Holland, Alsace, Provence, &amp;c. The
attempt to cultivate it in England, like that of Indian corn, has proved
a complete failure. The English, for a long time, depended upon Holland
for their supplies; but now large quantities are imported from France
and Turkey, under a duty of two shillings sterling on the manufactured,
and sixpence on the roots. The duties, formerly, were much higher.</p>

<p>The plant is raised from seed, and requires three years to come to
maturity. It is, however, often pulled in eighteen months, without
injury to the quality, the quantity only being smaller. It requires a
light vegetable mould, that retains the greatest quantity of water and
adheres the least to the tools. When the soil is impregnated with an
alkaline matter, the root acquires a red color, in other cases it is
yellow. The latter is preferred in England, from the long habit of using
Dutch madder, which is of this color; but in France, the red sells at a
higher price, being used for Turkey red die.</p>

<p>The Zealand or Dutch madder is prepared for market in a manufactured
state; and is known in trade by the terms, <i>mull</i>, <i>gamene</i>, <i>ombro</i>,
and <i>crops</i>. In some other countries, the roots are packed up
promiscuously, and the article is sold by the quintal. The price of
madder, like every thing else, is affected by the quantity in market,
and ranges in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> France from its minimum 22, to 100 francs a quintal. It
does not deteriorate by age. The quantity used in this country is very
considerable&mdash;but nothing equal to that required in Great Britain. For
the particular manner of cultivating madder, the reader is referred to
an excellent essay upon that subject, from the pen of M. De Casparin,
which was laid before the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and a prize
awarded to its author.</p>

<p>The <i>mulberry</i> is grown with little difficulty in these latitudes, and
therefore, silk may be produced in abundance, and rendered an article of
domestic and commercial consequence. Plantations have already been
commenced in several of the parishes, which will soon test the
feasibility of the undertaking. A gentleman by the name of Vasseur,
recently from France, has purchased land and made preparations to enter
into that business, under many years of experience. In the parish of St.
James, particularly, considerable attention is being paid to the culture
of silk. It would be extremely gratifying to be able to lay the result
of these experiments before the reader; but the necessary information is
not at hand.</p>

<p><i>Hemp</i> is raised in Missouri and Kentucky to some extent, as the
quantities annually landed on the levee in New Orleans afford ample
evidence. The demand for it will be good for many years, and the hint
should not be neglected by the citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> of Louisiana, who possess the
higher grounds, which are calculated for its production. When it is
considered that this is a raw material of vast demand, which has
heretofore been furnished from abroad, there can scarcely be any excuse
for neglecting the culture, provided the profits be equal to those on
sugar and cotton. The time may come, when even foreign nations will look
to this republic for cordage and duck; at all events, we should not
depend upon them for articles necessary for domestic purposes, and
especially for those which may with propriety be classed "among the
sinews of war."</p>

<p>Specimens of <i>tobacco</i>, the produce of seed imported from Cuba, have
been exhibited in this market, which are very little, if any, inferior
to the best from that island. These samples were raised by a gentleman
who resides near Jackson, who took no extraordinary pains in the
cultivation. The segars manufactured from them would pass, among good
judges, for the best Havana. This planter is of opinion that he can very
much improve the crops, by bestowing as much care upon them as is given
to the same pursuit in Cuba, and there can be little reason to question
his assertion.</p>

<p>The Natchitoches tobacco stands higher abroad, particularly for snuff,
than any other. This article is so well known in France, and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
places, that those who are engaged in planting it, boast that it
requires no protective duties, as it will be quite able to take care of
itself.</p>

<p>The only drawback upon the cultivation of tobacco, in this state, is the
worm, which begins its depredations in early summer. But much loss by
this annoyance might be avoided, by forcing the plants in their early
stage, in a hot-house, so that they might sooner be brought to maturity,
and two clippings be made before the advent of the worm.</p>

<p>The thin soil on lake Pontchartrain is found to be well adapted to the
<i>vine</i>. Already, considerable progress has been made in its cultivation
in that neighborhood, and grapes are abundantly furnished for the New
Orleans market. There is no doubt that wine might be produced in
abundance.</p>

<p><i>Indigo</i>, one of the oldest products of this state, has been superseded
by the sugar cane. Whether the planter has found more advantage in the
latter than in the former cultivation, can only be inferred from his
continuing to pursue it; for the maxim, that trade will regulate itself,
is nearly as applicable to agriculture as to commerce.</p>

<p><i>Grazing</i>, although it has been carried to a great extent in Attakapas
and Opelousas, has never proved so lucrative as might be supposed. Many
of the cattle perish there during winter, for the want of proper
nourishment. There is a grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> however, known by the name of <i>muskeet</i>,
an ever-green, which flourishes abundantly in Texas, spreads rapidly, is
exceedingly nutritious, and much sought for by animals, and might easily
be introduced into these prairies. This improvement would make this
section of country the best for grazing in the United States. More
attention is being paid to breeding cattle, and the improvement of
stock, than formerly. Sheep may be raised among the hills, in and about
Natchitoches, in almost any numbers. In Lafourche, also, although they
are of small size, they are fat and of fine flavor. This is a business
which is yet in its infancy here. The capabilities for its extension are
immense, and there is no doubt that the enterprise of the inhabitants
will soon find means to make it profitable. The mutton of this state is
already superior to any produced in the Union; good judges in these
matters have even pronounced it to be equal to the best English.</p>

<p>The minerals of Louisiana, so far as known, are very limited. Lead has
only been found in fragments; and none of these have proved to be rich.
Valuable beds of gypseous marl exist in the vicinity of the Wachita,
which admit of being worked to great advantage. Lignite coal has been
discovered in tertiary formations, which never present any article of
this kind beyond an ordinary quality, the better being always confined
to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> secondary strata. On the lands north of lake Pontchartrain, clay
exists of an excellent quality and very pure, suitable for manufacturing
not only the best bricks, but pottery of all kinds. It is to be hoped
that this will remedy the great evil that New Orleans has hitherto
experienced, by the use of a bad material for buildings. This has arisen
from the employment of a substance too near the surface of the earth;
whereas, by going a little deeper, a prime clay is obtained, that would
bid defiance, when well burnt, to the humidity peculiar to this southern
atmosphere.</p>

<p>New Orleans, the capital of Louisiana, stands on the right side of the
Mississippi, in ascending, ninety-two miles from its mouth. The river
here makes a considerable bend to the northeast, and the city occupies
the northwestern side, although its situation is east of the general
course of the stream. It is in latitude 29° 57' north, longitude 90° 8'
west; by the river 301 miles below Natchez; 1220 miles below St. Louis;
1040 below Cairo, at the mouth of the Ohio; 2004 below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> Pittsburgh; and
1244 south-west from Washington city.</p>

<p>In 1718, Bienville, then governor of the province, explored the banks of
the Mississippi, in order to choose a spot for the chief settlement,
which had hitherto been at Biloxi. He selected the present site, and
left fifty men to clear the ground, and erect the necessary buildings.
Much opposition was made, both by the military and the directors of the
Western Company, to removing the seat of government to this place.
Another obstacle, for a while, threatened almost insurmountable
difficulties to his design. In 1719, the Mississippi rose to an
extraordinary height; and, as the company did not possess sufficient
force to protect the spot from inundation, by dykes and levees, it was
for a time abandoned. In the November of 1722, however, in pursuance of
orders, Delorme removed the principal establishment to New Orleans. In
the following year, agreeably to Charlevoix, it consisted only of one
hundred cabins, placed with little order, a large wooden warehouse, two
or three dwelling-houses, and a miserable store-house, which had been
used as a chapel, a mere shed being then the only accommodation afforded
for a house of prayer. The population did not exceed two hundred. Thus
commenced what is now called the "Crescent City;" which, in a commercial
point of view, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, has
not an equal upon the face of the globe.</p>

<p>During the same year, a party of German emigrants, who had been
disappointed by the financier, Law, of settling on lands granted to him
in Arkansas, descended the river to New Orleans, in the hope of
obtaining passage to France; but the government being either unwilling
or unable to grant it, small allotments of land were apportioned them,
on what is now called the German Coast. These people supplied the city
with garden stuffs; and most of their descendants, with large accessions
from the old country, still cultivate the same land, upon a much
improved scale.</p>

<p>In September of this year, the capital was visited by a terrible
hurricane, which levelled to the ground the church, if such it might be
called, the hospital, and thirty houses; and three vessels that lay in
the river were driven ashore. So destructive was it to the crops and
gardens, that a scarcity of provisions was the consequence; and such was
the distress, that several of the inhabitants seriously thought of
abandoning the colony.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1727, the Jesuits and Ursuline nuns arrived. The
fathers were placed on a tract of land now forming the lowest part of
the fauxbourg St. Mary. The nuns were temporarily lodged in a house in
the corner of Chartres and Bienville streets&mdash;but, soon after, the
company laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> the foundation of the edifice in Conde and Ursuline
streets, to which they were removed in 1730; this place was occupied by
them until the great value of the land induced them to divide the larger
portion of it into lots. Their new convent was erected about two miles
below the city, and there they removed in 1824. At this period, the
council house and jail were built, on the upper side of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>In 1763, Clement XIII expelled the Jesuits from the dominions of the
kings of France, Spain and Naples. They were, consequently, obliged to
leave Louisiana. Their property in New Orleans was seized, and sold for
about one hundred and eighty thousand dollars. It is now estimated to be
worth upwards of fifteen millions. At the time of the expulsion of this
order, they owned the grounds which are now occupied by the second
municipality. The valuable buildings in which they dwelt, were situated
in Gravier and Magazine streets. Some of them were pulled down to make
room for the late banking house of the Canal bank, on the corner of
those streets. It is computed, that more than one half of the real
estate in this city, is derived from the confiscation of the property of
the Jesuits, under legal proceedings had by order of the French
government. The archives of the first municipality contain many
interesting and curious documents in relation to these proceedings, that
are well worth examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The first visitation of the yellow fever was in 1769. Since that time it
has continued to be almost an annual scourge. It was introduced into
this continent, in the above named year, <i>by a British vessel</i>, from the
coast of Africa, <i>with a cargo of slaves</i>. In addition to this
affliction, (the yellow fever above alluded to,) the colony was, during
the year 1769, transferred to Spain, and the capital was taken
possession of by O'Reilly, with a show of military power, and an
individual disposition to oppress, that brought equal disgrace upon
himself, and upon the government that commissioned him. The commerce of
this city suffered very much from the restrictive colonial system of
Spain. This, however, was removed in 1778, (a year memorable for a fire
that burnt nine hundred houses at one time) and, in 1782, the mercantile
interest of the place was benefited by still further extended privileges
of trade.</p>

<p>The census of 1785 gives to the city a population of 4,780, exclusive of
the settlements in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>In consequence of the commercial advantages above alluded to, a number
of merchants from France established themselves here, and British
trading vessels navigated the Mississippi. They were a species of marine
pedlars, stopping to trade at any house, by making fast to a tree, and
receiving in payment for merchandise, whatever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> planter had to
spare, or giving him long credits. The Americans, at that time,
commenced the establishment of that trade from the west to New Orleans,
which has been steadily increasing ever since. The idea of this traffic
was first conceived by General Wilkinson. A lucrative business was also
conducted by the Philadelphians, which the colonial authorities winked
at for a while; but the Spanish minister, finding that he did not
participate in the profits of it, as the Americans refused to comply
with his hints to consign to his friends, put a stop to it. He procured
a list of the names of the vessels, severely reprimanded the intendant,
Navarro, and so worked upon his fears that he began to prosecute all
infringements of the revenue laws, seizing the vessels, confiscating the
goods and imprisoning the owners, captains and crews. The venal
minister, perceiving that he had rendered himself extremely unpopular by
his intermeddling with the commerce between Philadelphia and New
Orleans, finally released all the individuals he had imprisoned,
restoring the confiscated property, and discontinuing any further
interference. The trade immediately received a new impulse and was
greatly increased. General Wilkinson at the same time obtained
permission to send one or more launches loaded with tobacco, from
Kentucky.</p>

<p>Soon after, many Americans availed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> of a privilege which was
granted, of settling in the country.</p>

<p>The first company of French comedians arrived here in 1791. They came
from Cape Francois, whence they made their escape from the revolted
slaves. Others from the same quarter opened academies&mdash;the education of
youth having hitherto been confined to the priests and nuns.</p>

<p>The baron Carondelet, in 1792, divided the city into four wards. He
recommended lighting it, and employing watchmen. The revenue did not
amount to seven thousand dollars, and to meet the charges for the
purchase of lamps and oil, and to to pay watchmen, a tax of one dollar
and an eighth was levied upon chimneys.</p>

<p>He also commenced new fortifications around the capital. A fort was
erected where the mint now stands, and another at the foot of Canal
street. A strong redoubt was built in Rampart street, and at each of the
angles of the now city proper. The Baron also paid some attention to
training the militia. In the city, there were four companies of
volunteers, one of artillery, and two of riflemen, consisting of one
hundred men each, making an aggregate force of 700 men.</p>

<p>A great extension was given to business in February of this year. The
inhabitants were now permitted to trade freely in Europe and America,
wherever Spain had formed treaties for the regulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> of commerce. The
merchandise thus imported, was subject to a duty of fifteen per cent;
and exports to six per cent. With the Peninsula it was free.</p>

<p>In 1795 permission was granted by the king to citizens of the United
States, during a period of ten years, to deposit merchandise at New
Orleans. The succeeding year, the city was visited by another
conflagration, which destroyed many houses. This reduced the tax upon
chimneys so much, that recourse was had to assessing wheat, bread and
meat, to defray the expense of the city light and watch.</p>

<p>At the time of the transfer to the United States, the public property
consisted of two large brick stores, running from the levee on each side
of Main street, (which were burnt in 1822,)&mdash;a government house, at the
corner of Levee and Toulouse streets, (which also suffered a similar
fate in 1826,)&mdash;a military hospital, and a powder magazine, on the
opposite side of the river, which was abandoned a few years since&mdash;an
old frame custom house&mdash;extensive barracks below those now
remaining&mdash;five miserable redoubts, a town house, market house, assembly
room and prison, a cathedral and presbytery, and a charity hospital. At
this memorable era, the grounds which now constitute that thriving
portion of the city, known as the second municipality, were mostly used
as a plantation. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> the property of a wealthy citizen named
Gravier, after whom one of the principal streets that runs through the
property has been called. How has the scene changed? At this moment it
contains a population of nearly fifty thousand, and has become the
centre of the business, and enterprise, and beauty of the city.</p>

<p>In 1804 New Orleans was made a port of entry and delivery, and Bayou St.
John a port of delivery. The first act of incorporation was granted to
the city, by the legislative council of the territory, in 1805, under
the style of "the Mayor, Aldermen and inhabitants of the city of New
Orleans." The officers were a mayor, recorder, fourteen aldermen, and a
treasurer. This year, a branch of the United States bank was established
in this capital.</p>

<p>The population of the city and suburbs, in 1810, amounted to 24,552;
having been trebled in seven years, under the administration of its new
government. The prosperity of its trade increased in an equal ratio.</p>

<p>At that time, the city extended no further down than Esplanade street,
with the exception of here and there a villa scattered along the levee;
nor above, further than Canal street, unless occasionally a house
occupying a square of ground. A few dwellings had been erected on Canal
and Magazine streets, but it was considered to be getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> quite into
the country, to go beyond the <i>Polar Star Lodge</i>, which was at the
corner of Camp and Gravier streets. [The progress of this municipality
has been greatly increased by the act for the division of the city,
passed by the Legislature in 1836, by which the second municipality
acquired the exclusive control of its own affairs.]</p>

<p>There was not then a paved street in the city. The late Benjamin Morgan,
who, some time after, made the first attempt, was looked upon as a
visionary. The circumstance which gave an impulse to improvements in the
second municipality, was the erection of the American theatre, on Camp
street, by James H. Caldwell, Esq., the only access to which, for long a
time, was over flat-boat gunwales. This was in 1823-4. He was ridiculed
for his folly, and derided as a madman&mdash;but time proved his foresight.
He was soon followed by a crowd that gave life and energy to that
section; and, in a few years, through the enterprise of others of a
similar spirit, the suburb of St. Mary has reached to its present
advanced state of elegance and prosperity.</p>

<p>The block where the Merchants' Exchange has since been built, was then
occupied by a row of frail wooden shanties; and the corner of Royal and
Custom house streets, where the bank now stands, was tenanted by Scot,
who now furnishes food for his hundreds a day directly opposite, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
who laid the foundation of his fortune, in the tenement that was removed
to make room for the present beautiful edifice.</p>

<p>Some of the old Frenchmen in the city proper, who have rarely trusted
themselves three squares beyond their favorite cabaret, are very
incredulous of the reported progress and improvement in the fauxbourg
St. Mary. A few years since, a gentleman of the second municipality
asked the old cabaret keeper, who has made himself illustrious and
wealthy by vending, to the habitués of the lower market, a drink of his
own compounding, called <i>pig and whistle</i>&mdash;why he did not come up into
the fauxbourg St. Mary, and see the buildings?&mdash;at the same time
describing the St. Charles Exchange, the Theatre, the Verandah, Banks'
Arcade, the magnificent stores, &amp;c. The old Frenchman, listened in
doubting wonder for some time; at last, however, his faith and his
gravity both gave way, and he burst into a laugh, exclaiming, "ah
Monsieur B. dat is too much! You von varry funny fellow&mdash;I no believe
vat you say&mdash;its only von grand&mdash;vot you call it&mdash;vere de mud, de
alligator, and de bull frog live?&mdash;von grand&mdash;grand&mdash;mud swamp, vere you
say is von grand city, I no believe it!"</p>

<p>The city proper is bounded by Canal, Rampart, and Esplanade streets, and
on the river by the levee, on which it extended about thirteen hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
yards, and back about seven hundred&mdash;in the form of a parallelogram.</p>

<p>This portion is traversed by twenty-two streets, forming eighty-four
principal and fourteen minor squares. The whole extent of the city,
including the incorporated fauxbourgs and Lafayette, is not less than
five miles on a line with the river, and running an average of half a
mile in width.</p>

<p>The houses are chiefly constructed with bricks, except a few ancient and
dilapidated dwellings in the heart of the city, and some new ones in the
outskirts. Wooden buildings are not permitted to be built, under present
regulations, within what are denominated the fire limits. The modern
structures, particularly in the second municipality, are generally three
and four stories high, and are embellished with handsome and substantial
granite or marble fronts. The public buildings are numerous; and many of
them will vie with any of the kind in our sister cities. A particular
description of these will be found in the ensuing pages.</p>

<p>The view of New Orleans from the river, in ascending or descending, is
beautiful and imposing&mdash;seen from the dome of the St. Charles Exchange,
it presents a panorama at once magnificent and surprising. In taking a
lounge through the lower part of the city, the stranger finds a
difficulty in believing himself to be in an American city. The older
buildings are of ancient and foreign construction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> and the manners,
customs and language are various&mdash;the population being composed, in
nearly equal proportions, of American, French, Creoles, and Spaniards,
together with a large portion of Germans, and a good sprinkling from
almost every other nation upon the globe.</p>

<p>The Water Works constantly supply the people with water forced from the
Mississippi, by the agency of steam, into a reservoir, whence by pipes
it is sent all over the city. This water is wholesome and palatable.</p>

<p>Gas was introduced into New Orleans, through the enterprise of James H.
Caldwell, Esq., in 1834; he having lighted his theatre with it several
years previous. The dense part of the city is now lighted by it; and the
hotels, stores, shops, and many dwelling-houses within reach, have
availed themselves of the advantages it offers.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1844, a fire destroyed about seven blocks of buildings
between Common and Canal streets, near the charity Hospital. The ground
has since been occupied with much better buildings, and presents a very
improved appearance.</p>

<p>The population of New Orleans, after it was ceded to the United States,
increased very rapidly. At the time of the transfer, there were not
eight thousand inhabitants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> and, at the present period, there are
probably one hundred and thirty thousand. During 1844 there were more
buildings erected than any previous year&mdash;notwithstanding which,
tenements are in great demand, and rents continue high. It will not be a
matter of surprise, if the number of inhabitants at the next census,
1850, should be over one hundred and sixty thousand.</p>

<p>The first ordinance for the establishment of a board of health in this
city, (so far as known,) was passed by the general council in June, of
1841.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The board consisted of nine members&mdash;three aldermen, three
physicians, and three private citizens. It was invested with ample
powers to adopt and enforce such sanitary regulations as were thought
conducive to the health of the city. This board performed all its
functions well during the first year of its existence. The second year
there was a falling off; but a dissolution did not take place till 1843.
In 1844, the board of health
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
having ceased to officiate, the general council invited the
medico-chirurgical society to take charge of this duty. This proposition
was accepted, and a committee of nine members appointed, with full power
to act as a board of health. If this body do their duty, as there is no
reason to doubt they will, much benefit may be expected to result. Their
advice to citizens, and strangers who were unaclimated, on the approach
of the warm weather of 1844, was certainly marked with a great degree of
good sense and seasonable caution. They will now be looked up to as the
great conservators of the health of the city; and, it is to be hoped
that public expectation will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>The following abstract of a Meteorological Journal for 1844 was
obligingly furnished by D. T. Lillie, Esq., of New Orleans, a gentleman,
whose scientific acquirements are a sure guaranty for its accuracy. The
thermometer (a self registering one) used for these observations, is not
attached to the barometer, and is placed in a fair exposure. Hours of
observation, 8 A. M., 2 P. M., and 8 P. M. The barometer is located at
an elevation of 28 feet above the level of the ocean; and is suspended
clear of the wall of the building. The rain gauge is graduated to the
thousandth part of an inch, and the receiver of it is elevated 40 feet
from the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Society, as at present constituted in New Orleans, has very little
resemblance to that of any other city in the Union. It is made up of a
heterogeneous mixture of almost all nations. First, and foremost, is the
Creole population. All who are born here, come under this designation,
without reference to the birth place of their parents. They form the
foundation, on which the superstructure of what is termed "society," is
erected. They are remarkably exclusive in their intercourse with others,
and, with strangers, enter into business arrangements with extreme
caution. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> once, and very properly, considered as the
patricians of the land. But they are not more distinguished for their
exclusiveness, and pride of family, than for their habits of
punctuality, temperance, and good faith.</p>

<p>Till about the commencement of the present century, the period of the
transfer of Louisiana to the United States, the Creoles were almost
entirely of French and Spanish parentage. Now, the industrious Germans,
the shrewd and persevering Irishmen, are beginning to be quite numerous,
and many of them have advanced to a condition of wealth and
respectability.</p>

<p>Next come the emigrants from the sister States, from the mighty west,
from the older sections of the south, and (last not least) from the
colder regions of the north, the enterprising, calculating, hardy
Yankee. To the latter class this emporium is indebted, for many of those
vast improvements which, as if by magic, have risen to the astonishment
and confusion of those of the ancient regime, who live in a kind of
seclusion within the limits of the <i>city proper</i>&mdash;to whom beautiful and
extensive blocks of buildings have appeared in the morning, as though
they had sprung up by enchantment during the night.</p>

<p>Then come the nondescript watermen. Our river steam navigation,
averaging, during half the year, some three hundred arrivals per month,
furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> a class of ten thousand men, who have few if any parallels in
the world. The numberless flat-boats that throng the levees for an
immense distance, are peopled and managed by an amphibious race of human
beings, whose mode of living is much like that of the alligator, with
whom they ironically claim relationship, but who carry under their rough
exterior and uncouth manners, a heart as generous and noble, as beats in
any human breast. They are the children of the Mississippi, as the Arabs
are of the great desert, and, like them, accustomed to encounter danger
in every shape. Combining all the most striking peculiarities of the
common sailor, the whaleman, the backwoodsman, and the Yankee, without
imitating, or particularly resembling any one of them, they are a class
entirely by themselves, unique, eccentric, original, a distinct and
unmistakeable feature in the floating mass that swarms on the levees,
and threads the streets, of the Crescent City.</p>

<p>Among them may be found the representatives of nearly all the states.
Some are descendants of the Pilgrims, and have carried with them the
industrious habits, and the strict moral principles, of their Puritan
forefathers, into the wilds of the West. They are all active,
enterprising, fearless, shrewd, independent, and self-sufficient, and
often aspiring and ambitious, as our halls of legislation, and our
highest business circles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> can testify. They are just the stuff to lay
the broad foundations of freedom in a new country&mdash;able to clear the
forest, and till the soil, in time of peace, to defend it in war, and to
govern it at all times.</p>

<p>Of the one hundred and thirty thousand souls, who now occupy this
capital, about twenty thousand may be estimated as migratory. These are
principally males, engaged in the various departments of business. Some
of them have families at the North, where they pass the summer. Many are
bachelors, who have no home for one half the year, and, if the poets are
to be believed, less than half a home for the remainder. As these two
classes of migratory citizens, who live at the hotels and boarding
houses, embrace nearly, if not quite, one half the business men of the
city, it may serve to some extent, to account for the seemingly severe
restrictions by which the avenues to good native society are protected.
Unexceptionable character, certified beyond mistake, is the only
passport to the domestic circle of the Creole. With such credentials
their hospitality knows no limits. The resident Americans are less
suspicious in admitting you to their hospitality, though not more
liberal than their Creole neighbors, when once their confidence is
secured.</p>

<p>The restrictions thus thrown around society, and the great difficulty
which the new comer experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> in securing a share in those social
enjoyments to which he has been accustomed in other places, have had an
unfavorable effect upon the morals of the place. Having no other
resource for pastime, when the hours of business are over, he flies to
such public entertainments as the city affords. And if these are not
always what they should be, it behooves us to provide better. Public
libraries, reading rooms, galleries for the exhibition of the fine arts,
lyceums for lectures, and other kindred rational amusements, would do
much to establish a new and better order, and to break down those
artificial barriers, which separate so many refined and pure minded men
from the pleasures and advantages of general society, condemning them to
live alone and secluded, in the midst of all that is lovely and
attractive in the social relations of life.</p>

<p>The character of New Orleans, in respect to health, has been much and
unjustly abused. At the north, in ratio to their population, the
consumption annually destroys more than the yellow fever of the south.
The city of New York averages about thirty a week. Patients with
pulmonary complaints, resort to these latitudes for relief, where such
diseases are otherwise rarely known. In truth, this capital shows a more
favorable bill of mortality, than any seaport town in the United States,
except Charleston and Baltimore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>There is little to be said in favor of the morals of New Orleans, during
the first few years after its cession. Report made them much worse than
they were. As the community was composed of some of the worst classes of
society, gathered from every region under the sun, nothing very good was
to be expected. But circumstances have changed. A system of wholesome
police regulations has been introduced and enforced, which has either
brought the desperate and the lawless under subjection, or expelled them
from the community. By reference to the statistics of crime, in other
commercial cities in proportion to the number of inhabitants, the
stranger will be convinced that this City has reason to be proud of her
standing. Riots here are unknown, robberies seldom occur. Personal
security in the public streets, at all hours, is never endangered&mdash;and
females may venture out after dark, without a protector, and be free
from insult and molestation. Foreign influence has entailed upon society
here a <i>code of honor</i> which, in some measure, has had a tendency to
injure it, but the false notion is fast falling into disrepute.</p>

<p>The new state constitution, if adopted, will put an effectual stop to
this barbarous practice. Article 130, reads,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Any Citizen of this State who shall, after the
adoption of this constitution, fight a duel with
deadly weapons, or send a challenge to fight a duel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
either within the state, or out of it, or who shall act
as second, or knowingly aid and assist in any manner
those thus offending, shall be deprived of
holding any office of trust or profit, and of enjoying
the right of suffrage under this Constitution."</p></blockquote>

<p>The learned professions here, generally, stand preeminently high. The
science of medicine may boast of a talent, and a skill, that would
confer honor upon any city in the Union&mdash;and the few empirics who
disgrace the practice, are so well known, that the evil is circumscribed
within very narrow limits. The clergy are proverbial for their learning
and eloquence&mdash;and the same remarks will apply with equal force to the
members of the bar.</p>

<p>This city, at the present time, possesses no public library. Considering
the population, and their ability, this must be regarded as a blot upon
the intelligence of its citizens. This is completely a commercial
community, however, and money is the universal ambition. Thence springs
that acknowledged deficiency in literature and the fine arts, observable
to the stranger. But shall it still remain? Is there no Girard&mdash;no
Astor&mdash;among our millionaires, who will leave behind them a monument
which shall make their names dearer and more honored in all coming time,
than those of heroes and conquerors?</p>

<p>After several attempts to establish a library, an association of young
men, some years ago, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> last succeeded in organizing one; but, for want
of proper aid and support from the rich, it lingered on for some time,
and was finally sold out by the sheriff! It then consisted of four or
five thousand volumes of well selected books. It was purchased by a
private gentleman, B. F. French, Esq. for a mere nominal sum. Thus has a
work intended for the honor of the city, become, in an evil hour, the
monument of its shame! It is soothing however, to learn that, at length,
a love of letters and the fine arts is springing up in our midst. Under
the head of Lyceums, National Gallery of Paintings, and Public Schools,
in this volume, facts illustrative of this assertion may be seen.</p>

<p>The Masonic fraternity in New Orleans appear to enjoy all their ancient
privileges. There are some ten lodges, besides a grand lodge, and an
encampment. Here is a large number of the order of Odd Fellows, as one
of Equal Fellows&mdash;a Typographical Association, and Mechanics, Hibernian,
St. Andrews, German, and Swiss societies. These are all, more or less,
of a benevolent nature; and within their own circles, have all been
extremely serviceable.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Mississippi, even by steam boats, in 1818, was
extremely tedious. The Etna is recorded as arriving at Shipping port, a
few miles below Louisville, in <i>thirty two</i> days. The Governor Shelby in
<i>twenty two</i> days, was considered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> a remarkably short passage. An
hermaphrodite brig was <i>seventy one</i> days from New Orleans&mdash;and a keel
boat <i>one hundred and one</i>; the latter to Louisville. Now, the time
occupied is <i>five to six</i> days.</p>

<p>During the business season, which continues from the first of November
to July, the levee, for an extent of five miles, is crowded with vessels
of all sizes, but more especially ships, from every part of the
world&mdash;with hundreds of immense floating castles and palaces, called
steamboats; and barges and flat-boats innumerable. No place can present
a more busy, bustling scene. The loading and unloading of vessels and
steamboats&mdash;the transportation, by some three thousand drays, of cotton,
sugar, tobacco, and the various and extensive produce of the great west,
strikes the stranger with wonder and admiration. The levee and piers
that range along the whole length of the city, extending back on an
average of some two hundred feet, are continually covered with moving
merchandise. This was once a pleasant promenade, where the citizen
enjoyed his delightful morning and evening walk; but now there is
scarcely room, amid hogsheads, bales and boxes, for the business man to
crowd along, without a sharp look out for his personal safety.</p>

<p>The position of New Orleans, as a vast commercial emporium, is
unrivalled&mdash;as will be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> by a single glance at the map of the United
States. As the depot of the west, and the half-way-house of foreign
trade, it is almost impossible to anticipate its future magnitude.</p>

<p>Take a view, for instance, of the immense regions known under the name
of the Mississippi valley. Its boundaries on the west are the Rocky
Mountains, and Mexico; on the south, the Gulf of Mexico; on the east the
Alleghany mountains; and, on the north, the lakes and the British
possessions. It contains nearly as many square miles, and more tillable
ground, than all continental Europe, and, if peopled as densely as
England, would sustain a population of five hundred millions&mdash;more than
half of the present inhabitants of the earth. Its surface is generally
cultivable, and its soil rich, with a climate varying to suit all
products, for home consumption or a foreign market. The Mississippi is
navigable twenty one hundred miles&mdash;passing a small portage, three
thousand may be achieved. It embraces the productions of many climates,
and a mining country abounding in coal, lead, iron and copper ore, all
found in veins of wonderful richness. The Missouri stretches thirty nine
hundred miles to the Great Falls, among the Flat Foot Indians, and five
thousand from New Orleans. The Yellow Stone, navigable for eleven
hundred miles, the Platte for sixteen hundred, and the Kanzas for twelve
hundred, are only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> tributaries to the latter river. The Ohio is two
thousand miles to Pittsburgh, receiving into her bosom from numerous
streams, the products of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Western
Virginia, Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. The Arkansas, Big Black,
Yazoo, Red River, and many others, all pouring their wealth into the
main artery, the Mississippi, upon whose mighty current it floats down
to the grand reservoir, New Orleans.</p>

<p>The Mississippi valley contained over eight millions of inhabitants in
1840, having gained eighty per cent., during the last ten years. The
present number cannot be less than ten millions.</p>

<p>The last year, the Mississippi was navigated by four hundred and fifty
steamboats, many of which are capable of carrying 2,500 bales of cotton,
making an aggregate tonnage of ninety thousand. They cost above seven
millions of dollars; and to navigate them, required nearly fifteen
thousand persons&mdash;the estimated expense of their navigation is over
thirteen millions of dollars. The increase since, may be calculated at
fifty additional boats&mdash;which would make an advance in all these items
in a ratio of ten per cent.</p>

<p>Such statements as these, large as they seem, convey to the reader but a
partial idea of the great valley, and of the wide extent of country upon
which this city leans, and which guaranties her present and future
prosperity. To form a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> estimate, he must, besides all this, see her
mountains of iron, and her <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inexaustible'">inexhaustible</ins> veins of lead and copper ore,
and almost boundless regions of coal. The first article mentioned (and
the phrase in which it is expressed is no figure of speech) has been
pronounced, by the most scientific assayer of France, to be superior to
the best Swedish iron. These, and a thousand unenumerated products,
beside the well known staples, constitute its wealth; all of which by a
necessity of nature, must flow through our Crescent City, to find an
outlet into the great world of commerce. With such resources nothing
short of some dreadful convulsion of nature, or the more dreadful
calamity of war, can prevent New Orleans from becoming, if not the
first, next in commercial importance to the first city in the United
States&mdash;perhaps, in the world. The flourishing towns upon the
Mississippi and her tributaries, are merely the depositories for this
great mart. In twenty years she must, according to her present increase,
contain a population of three hundred thousand, with a trade
proportionably extended.</p>

<p>With such views, it may be deemed folly to attempt to look forward to
the end of the nineteenth century, when this metropolis will in all
probability extend back to lake Pontchartrain, and to Carrolton on the
course of the river. The swamps, that now only echo to the hoarse
bellowing of the alligator, will then be densely built upon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> and
rendered cheerful by the gay voices of its inhabitants, numbering at
least <i>a million of human beings</i>. If, like Rip Van Winkle, we may be
permitted to come back after the lapse of half a century, with what
surprise and astonishment shall we witness the change which the
enterprise of man will have wrought. But let us not waste a moment in
dreaming about it. Let us be up and doing, to fulfil our part of the
mighty achievement. It would not be strange, however, if the present
map, which is given to show the rapid growth of the city, by comparison
with one drawn in 1728, should then be republished with a similar
design, to exhibit the insignificance of New Orleans in 1845! We ask the
kindness of the critics of that period, should they deign to turn over
these pages, begging them to consider that our humble work was produced
as far back as the benighted age of steam!</p>

<h2><a name="PUBLIC_BUILDINGS" id="PUBLIC_BUILDINGS"></a>PUBLIC BUILDINGS</h2>


<p>Having noticed, in the preceding sketch, the most prominent features in
the history of this interesting section of country, it becomes a duty
now to present to the intelligent reader, and more especially to the
inquiring traveller, a description of such of the public institutions,
buildings, and places of resort, for business and amusement, as may be
deemed worthy of his attention. In attaining this object, it was
necessary to have recourse to the most carefully digested statements of
facts now existing, as well as to collect others from personal
inspection.</p>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES BARRACKS</h3>

<p>The buildings formerly used for the accommodation of the troops
garrisoned in New Orleans, were erected by the French about a century
since. These were directed to be sold in 1828, and ten years after were
demolished. The act was soon discovered to be an error, and in 1833, the
government determined to replace them. A plan was accordingly forwarded
to the seat of government and approved. On account of the difficulty of
obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> a suitable site within the incorporated limits, a location
was selected, by assistant quarter master Drane, about three miles below
the city. The works were begun the 24th of February, 1834, and completed
on the 1st of December, 1835, at a cost, including the enclosure of the
public grounds, of $182,000. The late Assistant quarter master J. Clark,
superintended the operation, aided by Lieutenant J. Wilkinson, who had
furnished the plans.</p>

<p>The Barracks occupy a parallelogram of about three hundred feet on the
river, by nine hundred in depth. The ground in the rear belongs to the
general government, to the depth of forty arpents, and can be used for
the benefit of the troops. The garrison was intended to consist of four
companies of infantry, but ample accommodation exists for a much larger
number. The quarters of the commandant occupy the middle of the front;
those of the staff and company officers being on either flank. The
companies are quartered in a hollow square, which is thrown back far
enough to give space for a handsome parade ground. In the rear of these
quarters are the hospital, store-house, and corps des garde, and still
in rear, and beyond the walls, is the post magazine, as well as other
buildings necessary for the comfort and convenience of the troops. In
front of the whole is a commodious wharf for the landing of supplies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i090.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES BRANCH MINT</h3>

<p>Is situated on what was once called Jackson Square, being nearly the
former site of fort St. Charles. It is an edifice of the Ionic order, of
brick plastered to imitate granite, having a centre building projecting,
with two wings; is strongly built, with very thick walls, and well
finished. Our limits will not permit us to go into a detailed
description of its interior arrangements; which, however, may be
generally spoken of as such as not to discredit the distinguished
engineer who planned it. The total length of the edifice is 282 feet,
and the depth about 108&mdash;the wings being 29 by 81, and the whole three
stories in height. It was begun in September, 1835; and the building was
perfectly completed at a cost of $182,000. The machinery is elegant and
highly finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> and, when in operation, proves an interesting sight to
visitors; which, from the gentlemanly urbanity of the officers of the
establishment, may be easily enjoyed. The square is surrounded by a neat
iron railing on a granite basement. The coinage of 1844&mdash;gold,
$3,010,000&mdash;silver, $1,198,500&mdash;making in all $4,208,500.</p>

<h3>THE CUSTOM HOUSE</h3>

<p>This establishment is conducted in an old building, quite too small,
even if the United States Courts did not occupy a considerable portion
of it. The square, in the centre of which it stands, is about 300 feet
each on Old Levee, Custom-House, Front-Levee and Canal streets; and,
from its peculiarly happy location, is well calculated for public
improvement. Considering the great commercial importance of New Orleans,
as being scarcely second to any city in the Union, it is a matter of
congratulation that the government are now disposed to place her upon a
more respectable footing, in regard to offices of this nature; which
have been furnished in a princely style to some of the sea-ports that
had less need of them. The immense revenue that flows into the treasury
department here, demands a suitable edifice for the transaction of the
business it creates. The site is the most eligible that can be imagined.
The Post-Office, United States Courts, and warehouses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> the storage
of bonded merchandise, can all have ample accommodation within its
limits; and a more desirable location for them cannot be found. An
appropriation of $500 was made at the last session of Congress, to
secure a suitable plan for the buildings to cover this spot. The plan
has been prepared by Mr. Gallier, and is highly approved by those who
have examined it. It is to be hoped there will be no unnecessary delay
in completing a work, in which the public convenience and economy, as
well the accommodation of the mercantile community, is so deeply
interested. If Mr. Gallier's plan is adopted, all the above departments
will be clustered together in one central spot, with ample room for
each, and in a structure that will be at the same time a durable
ornament to the city, and an honor to the nation.</p>

<h3>THE POST OFFICE</h3>

<p>Is located in the Merchants' Exchange. It has two business fronts,
besides a passage way through the building, where letters and packages
are received for mailing. The private boxes have their delivery here,
where also the publishers of newspapers receive their exchanges and
communications. The general delivery for English letters is in Exchange
Place, those for letters in the foreign languages, and for the ladies,
are on Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> street. The edifice seems to answer the purpose well; and,
considering the extent of the establishment, the duties of the office
have been managed much to the satisfaction of the public. But we look
for something more worthy of the place, when the new Custom House shall
rear its noble front to the <i>father of rivers</i>.</p>

<h3>THE STATE HOUSE</h3>

<p>Formerly the Charity Hospital, and purchased by the state in 1834, is a
plain structure, composed of a centre and two detached wings; and is
finely situated on the square enclosed by Canal, Baronne, Common and
Philippa streets. The main entrance to the square, which is laid off as
a pleasure ground, and well kept, is from Canal street. The principal
building is occupied by chambers for the senate, and the house&mdash;that for
the latter being recently constructed. There are also suitable rooms for
the different clerks, and offices required by the public business. The
chamber for the house of representatives is handsome, but, like some
others in more conspicuous places, badly adapted to public speaking.</p>

<p>In the right wing of the building is the office of the adjutant general
of Louisiana; it is also used as a temporary armory, until the law for
the erection of a new one is carried into execution. The left room is
occupied by offices for the governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> secretary of state, state
treasurer, and civil engineer.</p>

<p>The whole was built in 1815. It is in contemplation to erect an edifice
more worthy of the state, but when this will be done, or where located,
is as yet undetermined. It will probably not be within the precincts of
our city, as the late convention provides that the Legislature shall not
hold its sessions hereafter within sixty miles of New Orleans. It is
doubtless intended that the public servants shall do more work, and less
eating, drinking and carousing, than they have heretofore done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i094.jpg" width="500" height="403" alt="THE CATHEDRAL" title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE CATHEDRAL</h3>

<p>Or <i>Church of St. Louis</i>, is the principal and centre of three buildings
which stand on Chartres street, immediately opposite to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place
d'Armes</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> or Parade Ground. This edifice forcibly strikes the stranger
by its venerable and antique appearance. There is perhaps, none in the
Union which is on this account more impressive. The foundation of the
building was laid in 1792, and it was, to a certain extent, completed in
1794, at the expense of Don Andre Almonaster, perpetual regidor, and
Alvarez Real.</p>

<p>The architecture of the Cathedral is by no means pure, but is not
wanting in effect on this account. The lower story is of the rustic
order, flanked at each of the front angles by hexagonal towers,
projecting one half of their diameter, showing below Tuscan antes at
each angle, and above pilastres of plain mason-work, in the same style,
with antique wreaths on the frieze of the entablatures. These towers are
crowned by low spires, erected after Latrobe's designs, about 1814.</p>

<p>The grand entrance to the Cathedral is in the middle of the front, being
a semi-circular arched door, with two clustered Tuscan columns on either
side. This entrance is flanked by two smaller doors, similar to the
principal one.</p>

<p>The second story of the front has the same general appearance, as to the
number of columns &amp;c. as the lower one, but is of the Roman Doric order.
Above, and corresponding to the main entrance, is a circular window,
with niches on either side, above the flanking doors below. On the apex
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> the pediment of this story rises the chief turret, being in the
Tuscan style, and in two parts&mdash;the lower being square, about twenty
feet in height, with circular apertures on each side; the upper
hexagonal, having a belfry, with apertures at the sides for letting out
the sound, flanked by antes. The proportions of the order are not
observed in this belfry, which was erected about 1824, by Le Riche.</p>

<p>The Cathedral has a tenure, to speak in legal phrase, of every Saturday
evening offering masses for the soul of its founder, Don Andre. The
requirement is faithfully observed, for as the day returns, at set of
sun, the mournful sound of the tolling bell recalls the memory of the
departed. This building is almost inseparably connected, in the minds of
the old residents, with the memory of the venerable Pere Antonio de
Sedella, curate of the parish for nearly fifty years. This excellent old
man, adored for his universal benevolence, came to Louisiana, then a
province, in 1779, and is supposed to have performed nearly one half of
the marriage and funeral ceremonies of its inhabitants, until the period
of his death, at the ripe age of nearly ninety years, in 1837. This
venerated relic of by gone days lies buried at the foot of the altar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h3>ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH</h3>

<p>Is situated in Camp street, near Lafayette square. The design is a
triumph worthy of the genius of Gothic architecture, whether the
dimensions, or the splendor of the structure be considered.</p>

<p>The measurement is 93 feet by 164 on the ground; and from the side walk
to the summit of the tower, 190. The style is taken from the famous York
Minster Cathedral, and executed agreeably to the designs of Messrs.
Dakin &amp; Dakin, which were adopted by the trustees of the church. It
surpasses every attempt at a similar order on this side of the Atlantic,
and when completed, may proudly challenge comparison with any modern
parochial edifice in Europe. It cost about $100,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<h3>ST. AUGUSTINE CHURCH</h3>

<p>This structure, erected in 1841, stands on St. Claude street, corner of
Bayou road. It is about 50 feet front by 90 deep. The architect, Mr.
Depouilly, has displayed an excellent taste in its construction. The
style is of a mixed order, but extremely neat&mdash;and in such good keeping,
that the interior has the appearance of being much smaller than it
actually measures. The decorations are worthy of the sacredness of the
place. The colored glass of the windows throws a beautiful mellowed
light across the aisles, producing a chastened effect suited to the
solemnity of the place. Immediately over the altar is a full length
painting of the tutelar saint, which is executed with the bold hand of a
master. At the right of this is the Virgin Mary, little inferior to the
first, but finished with much greater delicacy of touch. Our Saviour is
conspicuously represented in the ceiling, over the centre&mdash;around which,
on the gallery below, and between the windows, are portraits of the
saints, arranged in the panel-work. Take this church altogether, it is
one of the neatest houses of devotion in this city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<h3>ST. ANTOINE'S, OR THE MORTUARY CHAPEL</h3>

<p>On account of the great increase in the population of the city, and
consequent greater number of interments, objection was made, about the
year 1822, to the performance of services for the dead in the Cathedral,
it being in a very prominent and public situation. Under these
circumstances, the city made a grant of a piece of land at the corner of
Conti and Rampart streets, to the foundation of the Church of St. Louis,
on condition of their erecting upon the same, a chapel, as a place for
the performance of the funeral ceremonies, in conformity to the catholic
ritual. In pursuance of this intention, a cross, marking the present
site of the altar of the chapel, was placed there with proper
ceremonies, on the 10th of October, 1826, and on the following morning
the building was begun. Its erection was prosecuted at the expense of
the catholic foundation, and completed within a year after its
commencement, at a cost of about $16,000.</p>

<p>It is a plain but very neat edifice, of the Gothic composite order; and
was dedicated to the most holy St. Antony of Padua, as its guardian. All
funeral ceremonies of catholics are performed there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h3>THE CHAPEL OF THE URSULINES</h3>

<p>An edifice strongly characteristic of our city, and well calculated to
cause reflection on the many and sudden changes of dynasty to which New
Orleans has been subjected. This building, of a quaint old style of
architecture, was erected, according to a Spanish inscription on a
marble tablet in the middle of the façade, in 1787, during the reign of
Carlos III, (Don Estevan Miro being governor of the province,) by Don
Andre Almonaster Y Roxas. It is exceedingly plain and unpretending in
its exterior, and chiefly interesting from its associations, and
extremely antiquated appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h3>CHRIST CHURCH, (EPISCOPAL)</h3>

<p>A fine Ionic building, situated on Canal, at the corner of Bourbon
street, was designed by Gallier and Dakin, architects, and its erection
begun in the autumn of 1835, under the direction of Mr. D. H. Toogood.
It was completed in the summer of 1837, and consecrated during the same
year. The cost of the edifice was about $70,000. The form of the
ceiling, being a flat dome, is much admired. The Rev. Dr. Hawkes is
pastor of this church.</p>

<h3>ST. PAUL'S CHURCH, (EPISCOPAL)</h3>

<p>This is a neat frame structure, located on the corner of Camp and
Bartholomew streets. The Rev. Mr. Goodrich officiates in this church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE ANNUNCIATION CHURCH, (EPISCOPAL)</h3>

<p>Is to occupy a conspicuous place near Annunciation Square. The location
was selected with good taste, both in regard to the beauty of the
position, and to the great improvements of the neighborhood. The church
is to be placed under the pastoral charge of the Rev. Mr. Prescot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/i102.jpg" width="382" height="500" alt="THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH," title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH</h3>

<p>Is an edifice of the Grecian Doric order, finely situated, fronting on
Lafayette square&mdash;the handsomest public ground in the city. The basement
story is of granite; the superstructure being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> brick, plastered to
imitate stone. The building was commenced in November, 1834, and opened
for public worship in July, of the following year. It was finished by
subscription, at a cost of $55,000. In 1844, this building was
considerably enlarged. In the court, in front, a neat obelisk has been
erected, as a monument to the memory of the Rev. Sylvester Larned, first
Presbyterian pastor of this city, who died 31st August, 1820, at the
early age of 24, much and deservedly regretted. Rev. Mr. Scott, is the
present pastor.</p>

<h3>THE SECOND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH</h3>

<p>This is a plain and unpretending structure, on the corner of Calliope
and Phytanee streets; and like its near neighbor, St. Paul's, evidently
erected more for utility than for external display. It is a neat frame
building, with only sufficient ornament to give to it the appearance of
a place of public worship. Rev. Mr. Stanton is the pastor.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH</h3>

<p>Is an edifice of brick, in the plain Gothic style of architecture. It
was erected in 1817, on St. Charles street at the corner of Gravier,
where formerly stood the store-houses of the Jesuits, and upon a part of
the foundations of those buildings. Rev. Mr. Clapp, is the pastor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i104.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH," title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH</h3>

<p>At the corner of Poydras and Carondelet streets, is of the Grecian Doric
order, the details of which are copied from the temple of Theseus, at
Athens. The height of the steeple is 170 feet from the side walk. This
edifice was erected in the year 1836-7, by Messrs. Dakin, and Dakin,
architects, at an expense of $50,000. Rev. Mr. Nicholson officiating as
pastor.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH</h3>

<p>Is under the pastoral care of Rev. Mr. Hinton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<h3>WESLEYAN CHAPEL</h3>

<p>This is a plain frame building, on St. Paul near Poydras street, and is
devoted to the colored portion of the community.</p>

<h3>THE OLD URSULINE CONVENT</h3>

<p>Situated in Conde street, was completed by the French government, in
1733; and is therefore, probably, the most ancient edifice in Louisiana.
The architecture is plain, being Tuscan composite, and the smallness of
the windows, and the peculiar form of the roof and chimneys, together
with the general venerable and time worn aspect of the building, render
it, independent of its history, an object of interest to both citizens
and strangers.</p>

<p>It was occupied by the Ursuline nuns for nearly a century; and only
abandoned by them, when, on account of the great rise in the value of
real estate around it, they disposed of a part of their property, and
removed, in 1824, to the new convent, two miles below the city. It was
then used by the state legislature, as a place for their sessions, until
their present accommodations were prepared for their reception, in 1834.
Since that period it has been inhabited by the Right Rev. Bishop Blanc,
and several other of the higher clergy of the diocess. From its great
solidity of construction, there is no reason to doubt but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> it may
stand many years longer, as a monument of "the olden times."</p>

<h3>THE NEW CONVENT</h3>

<p>This richly endowed establishment was founded in 1826, and the chapel
was completed in 1829. The main building is about 100 feet long, of
brick, two stories high, and has two wings, running from the rear, at
each end. It is principally occupied as a seminary for the education of
young ladies. The average price for instruction and board is $200 per
annum. The number of scholars at present is 120. On a line with this
building is the nunnery, containing 40 sisters of the Ursuline order.
Annexed to the latter edifice is the chapel, a remarkably neat and plain
structure. Immediately in front of the latter building is the residence
of the priests. There are eighty acres of land, three of which are
enclosed and beautifully embellished. The position is pleasant and
healthy. It fronts upon the river, two miles below the city, and
embraces a charming view of the Mississippi.</p>

<h3>THE CARMELITE CONVENT</h3>

<p>Is a frame building, which stands upon ground adjoining the church of
St. Augustine, and is occupied by the nuns of this order. They have an
excellent school under their care, divided into two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> apartments&mdash;one of
which is appropriated to white and the other to free colored children,
many of the latter class, have wealthy parents, and pay a high price for
their education.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i107.jpg" width="500" height="311" alt="THE CYPRESS GROVE CEMETERY." title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE CYPRESS GROVE CEMETERY</h3>

<p>This resting place for the dead is about four miles from the centre of
the city upon the right of the upper Shell Road, that leads to lake
Pontchartrain, and occupies a ridge, which is supposed once to have been
the embankment of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The plat of ground devoted to the cemetery, measures 244 by 2700 feet.
The spot was purchased and improved at an expense of $35,000, by the
Firemen's Charitable Association. The revenue that arises from
interments is exclusively devoted to benevolent purposes&mdash;all the
business of the association being conducted by its members without any
compensation. The front wall and lodges are built in pure Egyptian
style, and cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> $8,000. The grounds are divided into avenues, and
arranged and embellished with an effect appropriate to the solemn
associations of the place.</p>

<p>The simple and striking motto over the entrance is selected from
Pierpont:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here to thy bosom, mother earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take back in peace, what thou hast given;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, all that is of heavenly birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O God, in peace recall to heaven."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the tombs are very richly wrought&mdash;and, one in particular,
erected by a fire company, a memento to a brother who was killed in the
performance of his duty, is a specimen of superior skill and
workmanship. The nature of the soil admits graves to be sunk six feet
without approaching water. They are laid with brick and securely
cemented. The tombs above ground (here called ovens, which they somewhat
resemble) are faced with marble, built in the best manner. There are
four hundred of them, which cost an average of twenty-five dollars each.
These are sold at fifty dollars, and the surplus goes into the funds of
the society, for charitable purposes.</p>

<p>A central avenue, twenty-eight feet in width, called Live Oak Avenue,
traverses the whole length of the ground. Cedar and Magnolia avenues, on
either side of this, are each twenty feet wide. Next the outer walls,
are those named Cypress and Willow, of eighteen feet each. At a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
distance of every two hundred feet, are transverse avenues. The spaces
between these are reserved for the erection of tombs, and may be
purchased at a stipulated price, according to the location. These
privileges are sold in fee for ever, and the title is held sacred in the
eye of the law.</p>

<h3>CATHOLIC CEMETERIES</h3>

<p>Of these there are two. The larger ranges between Robertson and
Claiborne, and extends from St. Louis to Canal streets, occupying four
full squares. The square on St. Louis street is principally appropriated
to natives of France and their descendants. There is a great deal of
refined sentiment and delicate fancy in some of their memorials of the
departed. Tombs are often embellished with fresh flowers, that look as
if they received daily attentions. This is a custom not peculiar to the
French, but seems to be the natural language of that refined affection,
which cherishes the memory and the virtues of the dead, among the
dearest and most sacred treasures of the heart. The smaller of these
grounds lies on Basin and St. Louis streets. It presents, like the
other, many tasteful monuments, that show us where repose the honored
and the wealthy of the land. These necessarily attract the notice of
strangers&mdash;but there is one among them less conspicuous than the rest,
the eloquence of whose simple and touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> memorial has rarely been
surpassed. It is in the side wall, near the northwest corner of the
cemetery, surrounded by many more of a similar construction. There is no
display&mdash;only a simple record, that tells it is occupied by a female
fifteen years of age. Beneath this is quite a plain stone, with the
inscription "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma pauvre fille!</i>" What an affecting history in those
three brief words! It was undoubtedly placed there by an affectionate
mother, deploring the untimely death of a beloved daughter. It contains
more pathos, and speaks to the heart with more effect, than volumes of
labored eulogy, or frantic grief. The proud mausoleum, and the turgid
epitaph, sink into insignificance beside this humble burst of maternal
love&mdash;"<i>My poor child!</i>"</p>

<p>Illustrative of the false pride with which the Creole population still,
unfortunately, regard the practice of duelling, nearly opposite is the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Victime de l'honneur.</i><br />
Aet. 24."<br />
</div>

<h3>THE PROTESTANT CEMETERY</h3>

<p>This burial place fronts on St. Paul street, and occupies about two city
squares. The inscriptions do not date back beyond 1810. It is a spot,
however, where the northern and eastern traveller will often recognize
familiar names of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> have found graves far from endeared friends
and connexions. There is little of the display here that is observed in
other grounds. Tombs that, apparently, were commenced with a resolution
to show honor to the departed, have been left without a stone to record
the name of the neglected tenant.</p>

<p>In one of the side walls, is a tomb stone of plain white marble, with
only the words, "<span class="smcap">My husband!</span>" engraven upon it. In this vault were
deposited the remains of a distinguished tragedian, who fell a victim to
the yellow fever, some years since, in this city. It is a delicate
souvenir, that bespeaks the true feeling and affection of a desolate
widow. On another is the emphatic inscription, "<i>Poor Caroline!</i>"</p>

<h3>ST. PATRICK'S CEMETERY</h3>

<p>Is situated within sight of the Cypress Grove Cemetery, and having been
but recently commenced, has not yet become an object of much attraction.</p>

<p>There is quite a spacious Catholic burying ground near Bayou road, more
than a mile back of the city, that seems to have been considerably used,
but has few monuments of any interest.</p>

<p>Besides these, there is a general burying ground at Lafayette. The Jews
have a place of interment, also, in that city.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARITABLE_INSTITUTIONS" id="CHARITABLE_INSTITUTIONS"></a>CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS</h2>


<p>There is probably no city in the United States that has so many
benevolent institutions as New Orleans, in proportion to its population.
Certainly it has not an equal in those voluntary contributions, which
are sometimes required to answer the immediate calls of distress. Here
are assembled a mixed multitude, composed of almost every nation and
tongue, from the frozen to the torrid zone, and, whether it be the
sympathy of strangers, or the influence of the sunny south, their purses
open and their hearts respond, like those of brothers, to the demands of
charity. To illustrate these assertions and to carry out the plan of
this work, a description of the most prominent of these establishments
is annexed.</p>

<h3>THE FEMALE ORPHAN ASYLUM</h3>

<p>Stands at the intersection of Camp and Phytanee streets, on an angular
lot, widening to the rear on Erato street. It has a northerly front on
the junction of the two first named streets, and occupies all the
grounds that are contained in this irregular space&mdash;the rear, however,
being reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> as a site for a church, to be erected at some future
period. The land was a liberal donation from Madame Foucher, and her
brother, Francis Soulet. Previous to the erection of this building, the
establishment was conducted in rented tenements, under the direction of
the Sisters of Charity; in whose hands it still continues to present a
praiseworthy example of neatness and parental care. It commenced in 1836
with <i>six</i> children; and, in 1839, with great exertions, it accommodated
<i>ninety</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i113.jpg" width="500" height="382" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The history of this charity seems to trespass on the region of romance.
In its struggle, it received an important impulse from the suggestions
of a benevolent lady, Mrs. Pogue. In conversation with a female friend
of similar feelings, she remarked, "if a fair could be organized for its
benefit, and the opulent induced to patronise it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> money might be raised
to erect the necessary buildings." That friend told the Bishop; who,
taking up the hint, announced it from the pulpit. This led to the call
of a meeting&mdash;where, instead of a small assemblage, the rooms were
crowded with the wealth and beauty of the city. It resulted in the
collection of over <i>sixteen thousand dollars</i>! Thus, to almost a chance
expression from the kind heart of woman, New Orleans is mainly indebted
for the prosperity of one of the noblest of her humane institutions.</p>

<p>From this moment, the Asylum assumed a firm standing. A suitable house
was at once commenced. The second municipality gave a thousand dollars,
and the legislature at different periods, twelve thousand dollars. In
1840 the whole was completed, and the children, to the number of about
one hundred, took possession. Since that time they have averaged one
hundred and forty-five annually. They receive the rudiments of a good
education. At a suitable age they are apprenticed to persons of
character and responsibility; and a vigilance is continued, that
guaranties to them the kind treatment, which their isolated position
seems to demand.</p>

<p>The edifice, built by D. Hayden, cost over forty-two thousand dollars.
Though conducted <i>with the utmost prudence</i>, the institution is some
twenty-five hundred dollars in debt. In a capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> like this, where so
many of the citizens have princely revenues, and with them a princely
liberality, there is little doubt that arrangements will soon be made to
relieve it of this embarrassment. It has now about one hundred and sixty
children, of whom over thirty are in the nursery.</p>

<h3>THE MALE ORPHAN ASYLUM</h3>

<p>The Society for the Relief of Destitute Orphan Boys have their
establishment in Lafayette. It went into operation in 1824, and was
incorporated the year after. By a calculation of the first sixteen
years, it appears that an average of thirty-five have annually
participated in its benefits. Although its title would seem to imply,
that orphans only are admitted, yet the board are authorized to receive
any boy, whose destitute condition requires their protection.</p>

<h3>THE POYDRAS FEMALE ORPHAN ASYLUM</h3>

<p>This is one of the oldest establishments of the kind in New Orleans. It
was endowed by Julien Poydras, and possesses an immense revenue from
valuable improved real estate. They occupy on Julia, from St. Charles to
Carondelet streets, and extend back about two-thirds of an immense
square. It has for several years had an average of one hundred and
twenty children. The excellent system and regulations, in regard both
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> instruction and health, will not be disparaged by comparison with
the best institutions in the world. Possessing so much property and such
beautiful grounds, it is to be regretted that more spacious and
comfortable buildings are not erected for the accommodation of the
inmates.</p>

<h3>THE CATHOLIC MALE ORPHAN ASYLUM</h3>

<p>This institution is supported by an association, and by private
donations. The establishment occupies a large building fronting the
river, and a few squares above the New Convent. About one hundred and
seventy children receive the benefits of this charity.</p>

<h3>LES DAMES DE LA PROVIDENCE</h3>

<p>This association was formed in 1839. It consists of about one hundred
ladies, who each contribute a certain sum monthly as a charitable fund.
Its object is to render aid to the sick, the poor and the infirm. The
institution was put into operation by the benevolent French ladies of
New Orleans; and, were its resources equal to the kind feelings of its
members, it would be rendered a means of alleviating much distress among
the sick and destitute.</p>

<h3>THE SAMARITAN CHARITABLE ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>This institution was founded during the epidemic of 1837, for the
purpose of alleviating the wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> of the poor and the sick. They
established an office at that period, where some of the members, day and
night, were always in readiness to attend the bed-side of disease, and
to administer aid to the indigent. The late mayor, and many of the most
wealthy citizens are members; and, in time of need, the association is
liberally endowed by the spontaneous donations of the generous public.</p>

<h3>THE FIREMEN'S CHARITABLE ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>Was incorporated in 1835, and managed by a board of directors chosen
from each company, subject to certain restrictions. The officers, (a
president, vice president, secretary and treasurer,) are elected by the
board from members of the association, on the first Monday of January,
of each year. The object of this society is the relief of its members,
who are incapacitated from attending to business from sickness or
misfortunes not arising from improper causes. It makes provision also
for the benefit of their families&mdash;particularly widows and orphans. This
is a very laudable association, and every way deserving of the excellent
fire department from which it originated.</p>

<h3>YOUNG MEN'S HOWARD ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>This benevolent institution was established in 1837; and its object is
the relief of the indigent and sick. Its resources depend entirely upon
public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> contributions&mdash;and appeals for aid have always been responded to
with alacrity. During the prevalence of the epidemic of 1841, this
society collected and distributed over five thousand dollars among the
sufferers on that dreadful occasion. It is a noble charity that waits
not for calls upon its benevolence; but its members seek for worthy
objects in the hidden recesses of misery, and soothe and administer to
their wants, with a brotherly solicitude that does honor to the name
they have assumed.</p>

<h3>THE HEBREW BENEVOLENT SOCIETY</h3>

<p>Although but a short time in existence, has accomplished much good;
diffusing charity, not in mere accordance with sectional prejudices, but
in that catholic spirit of genuine benevolence, which freely dispenses
its benefits alike upon Jew and Christian, and recognizes but one
brotherhood in the family of man.</p>

<h3>THE MILNE ORPHAN ASYLUM</h3>

<p>This institution was endowed in 1839, by Alexander Milne, a liberal
Scotch gentleman, from whom it takes its name. It was established for
the education and protection of helpless orphan children of both sexes.</p>

<p>No city in the United States is so well provided with establishments of
this kind as New Orleans. Here, the only passport required for admission
to the best attendance, is sickness, or an injury. No cold formalities
are thrown in the way of the suffering patient. Indeed, it has become a
subject of complaint, that access is so easy, and the position so
agreeable, that the improvident and the indolent take undue advantage of
its benefits.</p>

<h3>THE CHARITY HOSPITAL</h3>

<p>The first hospital for indigent persons erected in the city of New
Orleans, appears to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> built on the site formed by the west side
of Rampart street, between Toulouse and St. Peter streets. It was blown
down in 1779; and, being of wood, was entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1784, Dr. N. Y. Roxas commenced one of brick on the same position,
which he completed at an expense of $114,000 in 1786, and called it the
New Charity Hospital of St. Charles. He endowed it with a perpetual
revenue of $1500 per annum, by appropriating the rents of the stores at
the corner of St. Peter and Levee streets. It continued under the
patronage and direction of the family, until March 1811, when it was
relinquished to the city by authority of the legislature, the edifice
having been previously consumed by fire. It was now subjected to a
council of administration, appointed by the governor and city
council&mdash;(the first six, the latter three.) Since 1813 the council has
been appointed by the governor and senate. It consists of eight members,
and the governor. Its support has been derived from several sources. A
most liberal legacy was left it by that public benefactor Julien
Poydras, of real estate, valued at $35,000. Several smaller sums have
been received from other benevolent individuals. It has also received
aid from the state, directly and indirectly. Pennsylvania made a liberal
grant of $10,000, in 18&mdash;.</p>

<p>In 1812, the council of administration sold to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> the state the square now
occupied by the state house, with the buildings, for $125,000, and
purchased the present site, and built their large and commodious
structure at the foot of Common street, at an expense of $150,000,
containing sufficient room to accommodate four or five hundred patients.
This is the building particularly referred to in the heading of this
article. Besides being under the charge of the ablest of the medical
faculty, the institution has the assistance of the Sisters of Charity,
as nurses to the sick, who cannot be excelled in kindness and careful
attention.</p>

<p>The edifice itself is very imposing, from its immense size. It is
substantially built with brick. Suitable supplementary out-buildings for
lunatics, and lying-in apartments, are on the same grounds; and the
whole is encompassed by a permanent brick wall.</p>

<p>To show the great usefulness of this establishment, it is only necessary
to state that, during 1844, there were five thousand eight hundred and
forty-six patients admitted, seven hundred and thirteen of whom died,
and five thousand and fifty-nine were dismissed. Of this number, only
one thousand three hundred and sixteen were natives of the United
States, and four thousand five hundred and thirty foreigners. This year
the yellow fever was not epidemic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The following table, taken from the New Orleans Medical Journal, shows
the number of cases of yellow fever admitted into this hospital from
Jan. 1, 1822, to Jan. 1, 1844, with the dates of the first and last
cases each year, with the discharges and deaths, constituting a term of
twenty-two years.</p>

<p>"This discrepancy between the number of admittances, discharges, and
deaths," say the editors, "arises from the fact that a good many cases
of yellow fever occur, after the patients are admitted into the hospital
for other diseases&mdash;and some remain to be treated for other diseases,
long after having been cured of yellow fever; and, it may be, that some
cases are not noted upon the hospital books at all." The proportion of
deaths is accounted for by the exposed state of the patient before
admission. In private practice they do not average one death to ten.</p>

<p>The absence of quarantine regulations in New Orleans, is often remarked
by strangers. Acts of legislation have been passed at different times,
establishing laws for the protection of the city, which proved of but
little service, owing, it is generally admitted, to their not being
carried out as it is now known they should have been to test their
efficacy, consequently they soon fell into disuse.</p>

<p>Much able, and it would seem unanswerable argument has been employed, to
prove that this scourge of tropical climates is not contagious; yet, Dr.
Carpenter, an eminent and learned member of the medical profession of
this city, with great research, has tracked it through all its secret
channels of communication, by which at different periods it has been
introduced.</p>

<p>The recent able essay of Dr. Hort, read before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> the Physico-Medical
Society of this city, and the proceedings and resolutions of that body,
had in reference to it, with equal conclusiveness show it to be endemic,
or of local origin, and not an imported or contagious disease.</p>

<p>When such eminent "doctors disagree" what shall the unlearned and
uninitiated do?&mdash;we are surely in a dilemma, and hardly know on which
horn to hang our own humble judgment&mdash;but it would really appear that
with a sanitary system, commending itself to the more cautious views of
the Atlantic cities, an advantage would be gained, that would far more
than balance any diminished trade of our neighbors in the Gulf. Are
there not also, many hundreds of active, intelligent, business making
citizens, who now fly to the North on the first approach of the sickly
season, who, with such guards faithfully maintained about them, would
remain through the summer? and are there not thousands more in various
parts of the country, who, inspired with confidence by the existence and
maintenance of a system of measures which <i>they</i> deem essential to the
preservation of the health and lives of the citizens, would throng to
our metropolis as the most inviting field of enterprise, and thus
multiply our numbers and enlarge our business far more rapidly than it
can, or will be done under the present system?</p>

<p>If in making these suggestions it should be supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> that we have
"defined our position," we shall shelter ourselves under "the generally
received opinion," "the prevailing fears of the community"&mdash;and the
prudential measures of other cities.</p>

</div>

<h3>MAISON DE SANTE</h3>

<p>This noble edifice, emphatically the house of the stranger, was built in
1839, and opened in August of the same year. The full and complete
success of the enterprise is written in the grateful memories of the
thousands of patients who have resorted to it in the hour of sickness
and danger. The prices required secure to every sick person more than
the attention and comforts of the house of his childhood. Not a doubt
need to cross his mind but that all which science, and the most devoted
care can effect, will be done for him; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> only goes there to get well,
if it be possible in the nature of his case. The names of the attending
physicians, Doctors Stone, Kennedy and Carpenter, are a sufficient
guaranty for the respectability of this establishment.</p>

<h3>CIRCUS STREET INFIRMARY</h3>

<p>This institution, situated between Poydras and Perdido streets, was
established by Doctors Campbell and Mackie, in July, 1841. It is neatly
furnished, and offers all the comforts and advantages of a private house
to the invalid. No contagious diseases are admitted, and kind and
skilful nurses are furnished.</p>

<h3>THE FRANKLIN INFIRMARY</h3>

<p>Is situated in the Fauxbourg Franklin, in Champs Elysees street,
fronting the Pontchartrain rail-road, and about two miles from the city.
It is a private hospital, founded by Dr. C. A. Luzemburg. The building,
although not large, is accommodated with several out houses, and the
grounds are spacious and pleasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="500" height="322" alt="THE UNITED STATES MARINE HOSPITAL," title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES MARINE HOSPITAL</h3>

<p>Situated at Macdonough, opposite New Orleans, occupies a square,
measuring three hundred and fifty feet each way, which is enclosed by a
good substantial fence, intended, eventually, to give place to an iron
railing. The edifice measures, in front, one hundred and sixty feet, by
seventy eight deep&mdash;from the rear of which two adjuncts extend fifty
feet further back, leaving sufficient room between them for a spacious
court, immediately behind the centre of the main building.</p>

<p>The whole is laid off into three stories. It is fifty feet from the
ground to the eaves, and one hundred and thirty-five to the top of the
flag-staff, which surmounts the belvidere. It is built in the Gothic
style; and was designed by Mondele and Reynolds, who were the original
contractors. It was commenced in 1834, but for want of the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
appropriations by the government, the work was suspended, and has gone
so much to ruin, that it will require $20,000 to repair the damage.</p>

<p>James H. Caldwell, Esq., has contracted for the completion of this work.
The building, when finished and furnished for receiving patients, will
cost $130,000. It will accommodate two hundred and sixty nine persons.
The grounds, tastefully laid out, are to be embellished with shrubbery.
As seen from the Mississippi, or from a distance, this structure
presents a very majestic appearance. It stands in a healthy position,
elevated and dry; and from its great height, commands a complete view of
the river, city, surrounding country, and a whole forest of
masts&mdash;affording to poor Jack at once a delightful and a busy prospect,
that must have a great tendency to cheer the hours of his
convalescence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i129.jpg" width="500" height="359" alt="THE MUNICIPAL HALL." title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE MUNICIPAL HALL</h3>

<p>This edifice, when completed, will be one of the noblest public
buildings of the Second Municipality. It is to occupy the corner of
Hevia and St. Charles streets, facing the westerly side of Lafayette
Square, a site selected particularly on account of its conspicuous and
airy position. Its grand entrance ranges along the latter thoroughfare
90 feet, running back upon the former 208,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> and presenting an altitude
of 54 feet to the eaves, displaying two bold stories above a basement of
11 feet ceiling. This lower apartment is intended for the accommodation
of the military, and the police and watch departments. It is intersected
from end to end by a corridor twelve, and across, in the centre, by one
of fourteen feet wide, the latter giving room for a double flight of
stairs, which ascend to the upper story. The same division of passage
ways is observed on each floor.</p>

<p>The grand entrance from St. Charles street, is by a flight of eighteen
blue Quincy-granite steps, of which material the principal front is
constructed. At the top of these, at an elevation of fourteen feet, is a
platform extending along the whole front, twenty-five feet deep,
sustaining, by a range of six pillars in front, and four in the rear, a
massy pediment, all of which is of Ionic Grecian construction, and in
good keeping with the main fabric. On entering the corridor through this
portico, on the right hand, is an apartment seventy-five by thirty-five
feet, and, like all the others on this floor, eighteen feet in the
ceiling, appropriated to the library of the School Lyceum. In the rear
of this, on the same side, are four others for public offices and
courts, as are also those on the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Ascending to the third story, in front is the great hall, sixty-one by
eighty-four feet, and twenty-nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> in the ceiling, set apart for the
School Lyceum. Immediately in front of this, is a central platform,
advancing between two side rooms, over which are two others, similar,
all four of which are intended for the accommodation of the apparatus,
necessary for this new institution.</p>

<p>The main room is furnished with galleries on three sides, arranged in
the best manner for the convenience of scholars and spectators. The
rooms in the rear, like those in the story below, are devoted to public
offices.</p>

<p>The walls of this building are to be based upon granite, and the residue
of white marble, after the Grecian Ionic order. The whole will cost
about $120,000.</p>

<h3>THE CITY PRISONS</h3>

<p>These edifices are built of brick, and plastered to imitate granite,
they are three stories in height, occupying one hundred and twenty three
feet on Orleans and St. Ann streets, by one hundred and thirty-eight
feet nine inches between them. They are two in number, and divided by a
passage way that is closed to the public. The principal building has its
main entrance from Orleans street, through a circular vestibule, closed
by strong iron doors. The lower story contains the offices and
apartments of the jailor. The second story is divided into large halls
for such prisoners as require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> to be less strictly guarded. The plan of
the third story is similar. The whole is surmounted by a belvidere, with
an alarm bell. The cost is estimated at $200,000.</p>

<h3>SECOND MUNICIPALITY WORK-HOUSE</h3>

<p>This institution was formed in obedience to legislative enactment, under
date of the 5th of March, 1841. The buildings were completed and
occupied the same year. The site is a portion detached from the northern
extremity of the Protestant Episcopal Burying Ground, and the centre of
the front is directly facing St. Mary street. The plot is two hundred
and ninety feet, front and rear, and two hundred and fifty-five
deep&mdash;the whole being enclosed by a wall twenty-one feet high,
twenty-six inches thick at the base, and eighteen at the top, externally
supported throughout by abutments at a distance of every fourteen feet.</p>

<p>The entrance is by a strong and well secured gate, into a public passage
flanked by offices, over which are rooms assigned to the use of the
keepers, for the accommodation of the guard, and such <i>materiel</i> as good
order, and the safety of the establishment require. This structure is
partially separated from the prison by well constructed gates and
partition walls. Within, on each side, engrossing the residue of the
immediate front of the grounds, are two buildings. The one on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> right
is for white females, and that on the left for blacks of both sexes.
These tenements are divided from the other parts of the prison by high
fences of frame work. Going thence into the principal yard, the building
for the male whites is seen on the extreme right. This is of one story,
measuring eighty by thirty feet, and is the largest one on the premises.
Arranged along near the rear wall, extending to the left, are the work
shops.</p>

<p>The average number of white prisoners is eighty, not one-seventh of whom
are females; and one hundred blacks, a third of these also being
females. The prison discipline seems to be of a first rate order; and it
is seldom necessary to punish for offences against the rules. Religious
service is performed on Sundays, and a physician is in attendance every
day. It is a singular fact, that only five persons have died there since
it was opened, notwithstanding their former irregular habits. The
prisoners are kept at constant labor; and their food, though not
luxurious, is of a wholesome nature, which may, when their abstinence
from intemperate habits is taken into consideration, account for the
excellent state of their health. It would not be hazarding much to say
that many here were never before accustomed to so many of the comforts
of life&mdash;"in all, save these bonds;" for they lodge upon clean and
comfortable bedding, surrounded by moscheto bars; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> once a week, at
least, can enjoy the luxury of a bath.</p>

<p>This is the receptacle of that class of society, both white and black,
who are denominated vagrants. They embrace two sorts of
individuals&mdash;those who have no visible means of obtaining a livelihood,
and those who live by committing unlawful depredations upon others.
Besides these, colored seamen, while in port, not being suffered by the
laws to go at large, are accommodated, for the time being, with an
apartment in the Work-house. Slaves are placed here by their masters,
for punishment, for safe keeping, and for refusing to perform labor, as
well as for the commission of crimes. These last are sent out in gangs,
under keepers, to clean the streets, and to perform certain other menial
services within the control of the municipal authorities.</p>

<p>Nothing could render this establishment more complete, except a
classification of its inmates; so that the hardened offenders should be
prevented from drawing the young, the thoughtless, and the incipient
transgressor, into the vortex of their own viciousness. To the
philanthropist, this must be a consideration of the utmost importance.
The saying, that "evil communications corrupt good manners," is
illustrated even in this place&mdash;and here, many who seem upon the very
verge of destruction, might be saved from ultimate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> utter ruin, by
the judicious care and protection of the humane and reflecting
magistrate.</p>

<h3>THIRD MUNICIPALITY WORK-HOUSE</h3>

<p>This new establishment stands on Moreau street, running from Louisa to
Piety streets, and taking within its limits the building formerly used
as the Washington market, which has been altered to suit its present
purpose. The buildings were prepared under the superintendence of
Charles K. Wise, and are well arranged. The prisoners average about one
hundred&mdash;thirty of whom are females. The regulations are excellent.</p>

<h3>THE COURT-HOUSE</h3>

<p>This edifice stands on Chartres street, and to the right of the
Cathedral, as it is seen from the Place d'Armes, opposite to which it is
situated. The lower story is of the Tuscan order, with a wide portico
along the front of the edifice, supported by ten antes, between
semi-circular arches. The four in the middle are strengthened in front
by Tuscan columns, and those at the angles by two clustered pilastres.
The ascent to the second story is through the principal entrance, which
is composed of a semi-circular arched door, with antes at the sides, and
Doric entablature. It opens into a spacious lobby, through which, by a
stone stair-way, of a single flight below, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> double one above, the
second floor is reached. The front of the upper story is of the Ionic
order, but generally similar to the lower. The entablature is surmounted
by a denticulated cornice, and the pediment is relieved by an oblong
shield.</p>

<h3>THE CITY HALL</h3>

<p>This building stands on the upper side of the Cathedral, on a line with
the Court-House described above, both of which were erected the latter
part of the preceding century, through the liberality of Don Andre
Almonaster. This edifice in all general respects, much resembles the
Court-House on the right of the Cathedral, except that the main
entrance, under the portico, is of the Tuscan order; and that the stair
within is a winding one, leading to the upper story by three flights;
also, that the pediment of the front bears the American eagle, with
cannon and piles of balls.</p>

<h3>MARKETS</h3>

<p>The markets are a prominent feature in a description of New Orleans.
They are numerous, and dispersed, to suit the convenience of the
citizens. The prices of many articles they offer are very fluctuating.
Not dearer, however, on an average, than in New York. Stall-fatted meats
are not so usual here as at the North, preference being given to the
grass-fed. The mutton has no equal in America. Poultry and fish are
fine; and vegetables, except potatoes, are abundant, and speak well for
the soil that produced them. Fruit, from the West Indies and our own
West, is not only plenty, but of the best kind. The regulations are
excellent, and are strictly enforced by officers appointed for that
purpose.</p>

<p>The greatest market day is Sunday, during the morning. At break of day
the gathering commences&mdash;youth and age, beauty and the
not-so-beautiful&mdash;all colors, nations and tongues are commingled in one
heterogeneous mass of delightful confusion; and, he must be a stranger
indeed, who elbows his way through the dense crowd, without hearing the
welcome music of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> native language. The traveller, who leaves the
city without visiting one of the popular markets on Sunday morning, has
suffered a rare treat to escape him. Annexed is a brief descriptive
account of them.</p>

<h3>POYDRAS STREET MARKET</h3>

<p>Is designed for the accommodation of the inhabitants in the rear portion
of the second municipality. It covers a space of ground in Poydras
street forty-two feet wide by four hundred and two long&mdash;extending from
near Baronne to Circus street. It was built in 1837, and cost $40,000.</p>

<h3>THE VEGETABLE MARKET</h3>

<p>The ground plan of this building is irregular; having been constructed
at different periods. It approaches the Roman Doric order&mdash;is supported
by brick columns plastered, and covered with a wooden frame roof tiled.
It fronts on Old Levee, St. Philip and Ursuline streets, and the river.
The design was by J. Pilié, who superintended the work. It was completed
in 1830, at an expense of $25,800.</p>

<h3>THE MEAT MARKET</h3>

<p>Built in the rusticated Doric order, was completed in 1813, after the
designs of J. Piernas, city surveyor. The building is of brick
plastered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> with a wooden frame roof, covered with slate. It is situated
on the Levee, and extends from St. Ann to Main streets; and, from its
favorable location, and neat simplicity of architecture, is a striking
object to those who approach the city by water. It cost about $30,000.</p>

<h3>ST. MARY'S MARKET</h3>

<p>This building fronts on Tchoupitoulas street, and runs to New Levee, a
distance of four hundred and eighty-six feet by a width of forty-two
feet. It was completed in 1836, in the rusticated Doric order, at a cost
of about $48,000. In the vicinity, on the first named street, is a
vegetable market&mdash;a very neat edifice.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Besides these, there is a very respectable market at the head of Elysian
Fields street, near the Levee; and another in Orleans, between Marais
and Villeré streets, near the City Prison.</p>

<h3>EXCHANGE HOTEL, (ST. CHARLES)</h3>

<p>This magnificent establishment, which, for size and architectural
beauty, stands unrivalled, was commenced in the summer of 1835, and
finished in the May of 1838, by an incorporated company. The building
was designed by, and erected under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> the superintendence of J. Gallier,
architect, at an expense of $600,000, including the ground it stands on,
which cost $100,000. It presents fronts on three streets. The principal
one on St. Charles street, consists of a projecting portico of six
Corinthian columns, which stand upon a granite basement fourteen feet
high, with a pediment on the top, and four similar columns on each side
of the portico, placed in a range with the front wall; behind which is
formed a recess fifteen feet wide and one hundred and thirty-nine long,
and floored over with large granite slabs, which, supported on iron
beams, serve as a ceiling to that portion of the basement story standing
under the portico; and on top affords a delightful promenade under the
shade of the portico and side columns. The entrance to the bar room is
under this; and the outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> steps, leading from the street to the
portico, are placed on each side thereof, between it and the front range
of the building. In one of the rear angles of the basement is a bathing
establishment, consisting of fourteen rooms, elegantly fitted up, with
every convenience for hot or cold bathing. On the opposite angle are
placed the wine cellars, store-house, and other domestic apartments. All
the remaining parts of the basement are divided into stores, which are
rented out to various trades-people. The bar room is in the basement,
near the centre of the edifice; and is octangular in the plan, seventy
feet in diameter, and twenty high; having an interior circular range of
Ionic columns, distributed so as to support the weight of the floors and
partitions of the upper stories. The architecture of this room is Ionic.
That of the saloon, which is immediately over the bar room, is of the
Corinthian order, and eighteen feet ceiling. A grand spiral stair-case
commences upon the centre of the saloon floor, and is continued up to
the dome. Around this stair-case, on each side of the upper stories, a
gallery is formed, which gives access to six bedrooms within the
octagon, on each of the six upper stories. As the bar room is six feet
higher than the other parts of the basement, the entrance to the saloon
from the portico is by a flight of marble steps, twelve in number, and
thirty-five feet long. On the top of these steps is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> placed a beautiful
marble statue of Washington, presented to the company by John Hagan,
Esq.</p>

<p>The gentlemen's dining and sitting rooms occupy the whole side of the
building on Gravier street. The dining room, with a pantry at the end,
is one hundred and twenty-nine feet long by fifty wide, and twenty-two
feet high, tastefully finished in the Corinthian order, with two inside
ranges of columns, so placed that there is abundant space for four
ranges of dining tables, sufficient to accommodate five hundred persons.
The ladies' dining room is placed over the bathing apartments, and is
fifty-two by thirty-six feet. The kitchen, fifty-eight by twenty-nine
feet, is placed in the rear wing of the building, on the same story
with, and in the centre between the two dining rooms. The two angles of
the principal front contain the ladies' drawing room, and the
gentlemen's sitting room, the former forty by thirty-two feet, the
latter thirty-eight feet square. There are nine private parlors on the
second story, to some of which are attached adjoining bedrooms; and the
same number on the upper stories. There are four stories of elegantly
furnished and well lighted bedrooms, all around the four sides of the
building, with central passages, or corridors, which communicate with
the centre and with each other, having three stair-cases opening to the
corridors, besides the grand stair-case in the octagon. There are, in
the edifice, three hundred and fifty rooms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>A dome, of beautiful proportions, after a plan of Dakin, forty-six feet
in diameter, surmounts the octagon building, elevated upon an order of
fluted columns, which stand eleven feet from the dome, around the
outside, and on the dome is elevated an elegant little Corinthian
turret. There is a large circular room under the dome, on the floor of
which the spiral stair-case terminates, and around the outside of which
the circular colonade forms a beautiful gallery eleven feet wide, from
whence can be seen the whole city, and all the windings of the river for
several miles in each direction. The effect of the dome upon the sight
of the visitor, as he approaches the city, is similar to that of St.
Paul's, London.</p>

<p>No better evidence can be adduced&mdash;nor more flattering encomiums
presented to the architects, than the fact of the indescribable effect
of the sublime and matchless proportions of this building upon all
spectators&mdash;even the stoical Indian and the cold and strange
backwoodsman, when they first view it, are struck with wonder and
delight. The view of this structure by moonlight is a sight not easily
described. The furnishing of this establishment cost $150,000.</p>

<h3>THE VERANDAH</h3>

<p>So called from being covered on its front toward the streets, to a
certain height, by a projecting roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> and balcony, is situated at the
corner of St. Charles and Common streets, diagonally opposite the
Exchange Hotel. The building was intended for a family hotel, by its
enterprising projector and builder, the late R. O. Pritchard.</p>

<p>The great dining room, is, probably, one of the most highly finished
apartments in America. The ceiling, especially, is a model; being
composed of three elliptic domes for chandeliers. This room measures
eighty-five by thirty-two feet, and twenty-seven high. The chimney
pieces of the ladies' parlors are fine specimens of sculpture, and the
rooms are otherwise handsome. The sleeping apartments are not excelled.
The whole was designed and constructed by Dakin &amp; Dakin, architects, in
1836-8, at a cost of $300,000, including the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h3>ST. LOUIS HOTEL</h3>

<p>This building, as a hotel, may be considered as one of the most
respectable in New Orleans. It stands nearly in the centre of the French
portion of the population; and, in the combination of its brilliant and
business-like appearance, is not an inappropriate representative of
their national character. In this establishment the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">utile et dulci</i> are
so happily blended, that the accomplished guest can find no cause of
complaint. A more particular description of this superb edifice is
omitted here, in consequence of its being given under the head of the
City Exchange, to which the reader is respectfully referred.</p>

<h3>HEWLETT'S HOTEL</h3>

<p>This is a large and well-constructed building, on the corner of Camp and
Common streets. It has been long known as a hotel, but, during the last
year, has been opened, under new auspices, by the gentleman whose name
has become associated with that of the house. The position is airy,
healthy and central, and the table is said to be unexcelled.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Planters' Hotel, in Canal street, and the National Hotel, in
Tchoupitoulas street, are both good houses; and the prices being less,
they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> sought after by those who wish to economise their expenses.
There are several other respectable establishments, of which, like those
last named, the limits of these pages will not permit a particular
description.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>THE GAS WORKS</h3>

<p>Occupy a square fronting on St. Mary street four hundred and sixty-seven
feet, with a depth of two hundred and thirty-five feet on Gravier and
Perdido streets; which is enclosed by a substantial brick wall fourteen
feet high. The site was selected by James H. Caldwell, Esq., to whom New
Orleans is mainly indebted for this great undertaking, as well as for
many others which stand as lasting eulogiums to his memory. In 1834, the
original works were put in operation. Mr. Caldwell, at this time, had
the exclusive privilege of lighting the city for thirty years. His were
the fourth gas works in the Union, and the first west of the mountains.
The first wrought-iron roof in this country, was erected over the retort
house by Mr. C., and has served as a model for all since built. The
largest cast iron tank ever constructed was also put up by him. It is
fifty-one feet diameter and eighteen deep, and contains over two hundred
thousand gallons of water. In 1835 Mr. Caldwell disposed of this
property to the Gas Light and Banking Company; who, finding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
buildings insufficient, constructed them anew. The present establishment
was planned and erected under the superintendence of David John Rogers,
in whose care it still continues to prosper. The works, finished in
1837, cost $150,000. The whole present value is $650,000.</p>

<p>These consist of a retort house on Gravier street, one hundred and
seventeen by eighty feet, and parallel to which is the purifying house,
one hundred and seventeen by fifty-two feet. On the rear is the chimney,
constructed to resemble Trajan's pillar, one hundred and seven feet
high; and presents a chaste specimen of classical architecture. There
are three fifty feet gasometers, arranged along in the centre of the
premises, capable of containing thirty thousand cubic feet each, built
after the most approved workmanship, and considered to be superior to
any others in this country. On Perdido street is a three story dwelling,
thirty by seventy-five feet, for the workmen. The coal shed is one
hundred and ninety by fifty-two feet. In addition to these are the
blacksmith, carpenter, and other shops, necessary for advantageously
conducting so extensive a business. The structures are all fire-proof,
and every thing is kept in the neatest possible condition.</p>

<p>In addition to the works already described, and immediately in front of
them, embracing nearly another square, two more gasometers, of equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
dimensions, together with the accompanying buildings, have been
constructed during 1844-5. These will enable the company to transmit the
gas through a distance of one hundred and fifty miles of pipe,
sufficient for the accommodation of a half million of persons.</p>

<p>The gas is extracted from Pittsburgh coal&mdash;after which the coke is sold
for fuel, at about half the price that is asked for the original coal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i148.jpg" width="500" height="222" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE WATER WORKS</h3>

<p>In 1833, a company was incorporated under the title of the "Commercial
Bank of New Orleans," the principal object of which was to supply the
city with pure water from the Mississippi river. To effect this object,
an artificial mound was constructed on the square comprised within
Richard, Market, John the Baptist and Religious streets, consisting of
seventy thousand cubic yards of earth, taken from the batture (deposit)
of the river. The work was completed during 1834-5. The reservoir is
constructed on the top of this mound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> It is two hundred and fifty feet
square, built of brick, and divided into four compartments, measuring
each one hundred and eighteen feet in the clear. The walls and bottoms
forming the reservoir, are built with brick, and plastered with
hydraulic cement. A pavilion of an octagonal form has been erected on
the intersection of the partition walls, supported by eight pillars. It
is about fifteen feet wide and ten high, and affords quite a commanding
and pleasant prospect.</p>

<p>The reservoir is supplied with water from the Mississippi river, by
plunge pumps, worked by a condensing engine, acting expansively on
Bolton and Watt's plan. These pumps were adopted as the most
efficacious, on account of the great quantity of matter held in
suspension by the water. They are connected to a suction pipe sixteen
inches in diameter, and about eight hundred feet long; and to the main,
descending into the reservoir, sixteen inches in diameter and six
hundred feet long. The cylinder is twenty-five inches in diameter and
six feet stroke, and is calculated to raise three millions gallons of
water in twenty-four hours. The engine and pump houses are built of
brick, and are situated on the lot forming the corner of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Tchapitoulas'">Tchoupitoulas</ins>
and Richard streets.</p>

<p>The water is distributed through cast iron pipes, capable of sustaining
a pressure of water of three hundred feet head. They vary from eighteen
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> six inches in diameter for the mains&mdash;but the greater part of them
consist of the larger sizes, which have numerous ramifications of less
dimensions. There are two mains from the reservoir; one of eighteen, the
other of twelve inches bore, which are gradually reduced in size as the
distance becomes greater from the source, or as circumstances may
require. In 1836, water was first pumped into the reservoir. It can be
delivered in the upper part of the city twenty-one feet, and in the
lower sections, twenty-seven feet above the level of the soil.</p>

<p>The daily average consumption of water, during the year 1844, was one
million gallons; and, from the comparative great capacity of the
reservoir, sufficient time is allowed for the water to settle, in one of
the four compartments, before it is drawn for the use of the city.</p>

<p>Much good might be achieved by a more enlarged operation of these works.
The water is capable of being made fit for all domestic purposes, thus
obviating the necessity for cisterns, the birthplace of millions of
moschetoes, and, possibly the source of much sickness. For the purposes
of bathing it is almost indispensable; and, for forming fountains, to
cleanse the streets and to purify and cool the air, it may be rendered
equally a convenience, a luxury, and an embellishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h3>ARMORIES</h3>

<p>A room has been fitted up in Camp street, for which the substantial and
well constructed walls of the old Camp street Theatre have been used&mdash;a
building erected by James H. Caldwell, Esq., in 1822. This apartment,
used as an armory for the Washington Battalion, is sixty by one hundred
and twenty feet, and twenty-two feet high, and is decidedly one of the
largest in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Another armory is located at the corner of Perdido and Baronne streets,
in the upper part of the Carrolton Rail-Road depôt. Both of these
armories are the depositories of arms, all kept in the best order, and
disposed in various tasteful forms.</p>

<h3>THE FIRE DEPARTMENT</h3>

<p>There are in New Orleans, fifteen engine, three hose, and one hook and
ladder&mdash;in all nineteen companies. The city may justly boast of the
energy and efficiency of this arm of safety. The members are exempt from
military and jury duty; and, after a certain term, are enrolled as
honorary members, who are free from the performance of further service.
The expenses of the department are defrayed by appropriations from the
municipalities, and from fines imposed upon delinquent members.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The courage and bearing of these companies during a conflagration, are
much to be admired. They proceed with that cool and determined spirit
that shows a consciousness of their power in subduing the destructive
element. An excellent and convenient supply of water, which is always at
command, enables them promptly to extinguish the most dangerous fire.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="MANUFACTURES" id="MANUFACTURES"></a>MANUFACTURES</h2>


<p>In New Orleans, have, until recently been but little known. There are
now however, several actively employed and well patronised branches of
the manufacturing business; which, if not calculated to compete with
those in other markets, answer a very good purpose for its own.</p>

<h3>THE IRON FOUNDRY</h3>

<p>Of Messrs. Leeds &amp; Co. produces every variety of machinery, that
steamboats and manufactories require for extensive operations. It has
been established many years, at the corner of Foucher and Delord
streets, occupies nearly a whole square, and is on as extensive a scale
as any in the country. The business-like and prompt system practiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> by
the conductors, is known to all who require their aid upon the whole
line of the Mississippi and its tributaries.</p>

<h3>STEAM PLANING MILL</h3>

<p>Upon Carondelet Walk, has been in successful operation over four years.
Lumber is landed from Carondelet Canal, which passes in front of the
building.</p>

<h3>STEAM SAW MILLS</h3>

<p>Of these there are two; one located in the third municipality, the other
five miles below the city, and both upon the banks of the river. They
can furnish lumber of almost any description in abundance.</p>

<h3>ROPE WALKS</h3>

<p>There are several of these, in different parts of the city, where
cordage may be manufactured, to any extent, demanded by the business of
the place.</p>

<p>Besides these there are several Flour Mills, a Paper Mill, Sugar
Refinery, Cotton Factories, &amp;c., all in successful operation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE COTTON PRESSES</h3>

<p>This is the place of all others, for these extensive buildings, which,
generally, occupy a square, and sometimes more. They are numerous and
extensive establishments. A brief description of two of the most
prominent, will serve for the whole, as they very much resemble each
other in their construction.</p>

<h3>THE LEVEE COTTON PRESS</h3>

<p>Erected by a company under that name, was completed in 1832, at a cost
of $500,000. No architectural effect was aimed at in the façade, which
is, however, neat and plain. This establishment can press about 200,000
bales per annum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i154.jpg" width="500" height="202" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE ORLEANS COTTON PRESS</h3>

<p>This vast establishment fronts on the Mississippi, running back on
Roffignac and New Levee streets. The ground occupied is six hundred and
thirty-two by three hundred and eight feet, and is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> covered by
the buildings. The whole was built according to designs made by Charles
F. Zimpel, begun in 1833, and completed in 1835, at a cost, including
the site, of $753,558. The front on the river, although having no
pretensions to architectural effect, is still, from its location and
extent, quite impressive. This press can store twenty-five thousand
bales of cotton; and compresses, on an average, one hundred and fifty
thousand bales per annum; but its capacity is much greater.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h3>BANKS</h3>

<h3>LOUISIANA STATE BANK</h3>

<p>This building was erected in 1822, at a cost, including the ground, of
$55,000. The plan was from Latrobe, and Benjamin Fox the architect. It
stands on the corner of Royal and Bienville streets, and presents rather
a plain but neat external appearance. It is most substantially built;
the lower story is heavily arched, and the banking apartments are
completely fire-proof. Capital, $2,000,000.</p>

<h3>THE MECHANICS' AND TRADERS' BANK</h3>

<p>Is situated on Canal street, occupying only an ordinary house, compared
to some others, and requires no particular description. Capital,
$2,000,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/i156.jpg" width="406" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<h3>THE CITY BANK</h3>

<p>Is a building of the Ionic order, situated in Camp, near Canal street,
and designed by W. L. Atkinson, architect. Its construction was
commenced in 1837, and finished in 1838, under the superintendence of J.
Gallier, at a cost of about $50,000. The banking room is admired for its
elegant simplicity. Capital, $2,000,000.</p>

<h3>THE GAS BANK</h3>

<p>This building, in St. Charles street, between Canal and Common streets,
is so closely squeezed in among others, that it has little opportunity
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> show off the beauty it possesses. It was erected in 1839, under the
superintendence of Sidel &amp; Stewart, at an expense of about $25,000,
ground $25,000, making $50,000, and is every way well calculated for a
banking house. The original capital was $4,000,000, but it was reduced
to $180,000, and by request of the stockholders, the banking privileges
have been withdrawn by an act of the Legislature of 1845.</p>

<h3>THE CANAL BANK</h3>

<p>Has its entrance in the centre of the front on Magazine street, of a
substantial granite building which stands on that and the corner of
Gravier street. That portion of the edifice is very tastefully arranged
after the designs of Dakin, the architect. It was erected in 1845. The
residue of the structure is used for stores. Capital, $4,000,000.</p>

<h3>THE BANK OF LOUISIANA</h3>

<p>Is a fine Ionic building at the south-west corner of Royal and Conti
streets, surrounded by a handsome court. The whole edifice is well
arranged, the banking room in particular, is admired for its good
architectural effect, being 60 feet square, and of a proportionate
height, with a fine gallery above. It was commenced by Bickle, Hamlet
and Fox, builders, in 1826, and finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> the following year, at a cost
of $80,000. Capital, $4,000,000.</p>

<h3>BANKS' ARCADE</h3>

<p>Occupies the front of a square on Magazine street, between Gravier and
Natchez streets, having a main entrance, from each of those last named,
to the Arcade, which divides the building through the whole
length&mdash;being three stories high, and covered in with glass, to exclude
rain and admit the light. In the lower and second stories, are offices
of almost all descriptions&mdash;and the third is appropriated mostly to
sleeping rooms.</p>

<p>The bar room, opening on Magazine street, is 100 by 60 feet, and 35 in
height. It is handsomely embellished, has a gallery surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> the
upper story, and is a popular place for public meetings. It will
accommodate 5,000 people on such occasions. This building stands in the
centre of business, and, consequently, is a place of great resort for
merchants and others. Erected by Thomas Banks in 1833, Charles Zimple,
architect.</p>

<h3>CITY EXCHANGE</h3>

<p>This magnificent edifice, which is one of the greatest ornaments of the
city, fronts on three streets&mdash;about 300 feet on St. Louis, and 120 each
on Royal and Chartres street&mdash;the building being intended by the
projectors to combine the convenience of a city exchange, hotel, bank,
large ball rooms, and private stores.</p>

<p>The principal façade, on St. Louis street, may be generally described as
being composed of the Tuscan and Doric orders. The main entrance is
formed by six columns of the composite Doric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> order. Through this
portico, access is had to the vestibule of the Exchange, a handsome,
though simple hall, 127 by 40 feet. This room is appropriated to general
business, and constantly open during waking hours. You pass through this
into one of the most beautiful rotundas in America, which is devoted
exclusively to business, and is open from noon to three o'clock P. M.
This fine room is surrounded by arcades and galleries, always open to
the public, (Sundays excepted,) and its general appearance cannot fail
to impress upon the mind a most favorable idea of its grandeur and
beauty. The dome is most tastefully laid off in compartments, within
which the magic pencils of Canova and Pinoli have portrayed allegorical
scenes and the busts of eminent Americans, in rich fresco&mdash;a style of
painting comparatively new in the United States. The floors of the
gallery which engird the rotunda, and the winding stairs leading to
them, are of iron.</p>

<p>By a side entrance on St. Louis street, access is obtained to the second
story; the front of which, on this street, is occupied by a suite of
ball rooms and their dependencies. The great ball room is magnificent in
its size and decorations. The building also has a capacious entrance on
Royal street, as a hotel that can accommodate 200 persons. At the corner
of Chartres street are the public baths. In the spring of 1840 this
building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> was nearly burnt down&mdash;but, in less than two years, it was
completely restored to its original splendor.</p>

<h3>THE COMMERCIAL EXCHANGE</h3>

<p>This edifice is now being erected upon the south west corner of St.
Charles and Perdido streets, fronting one hundred and three feet upon
the former, and running one hundred upon the latter. The main part of
the building is to be constructed of brick and stuccoed; the upper
portion is purely Corinthian the lower entirely Tuscan. The principal
entrance on St. Charles street, is by a portico supported by two Ionic
pillars, and the same number of pilastres, composed of granite. The
vestibule is eleven feet deep, which admits visitors by three separate
doors into the exchange saloon, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> most spacious apartment of the kind
in the United States; it being seventy by one hundred feet, and twenty
seven to the ceiling, which is supported by twelve well arranged and
substantial pillars. At the rear of this public room are two others,
intended for the accommodation of auctioneers, leaving only sufficient
space on the left for the necessary offices and access to the second
floor.</p>

<p>The structure shows three stories in front&mdash;on the second of which is
the news room, expressly arranged for the occupation of the New Orleans
Reading Room. This apartment is fifty-five by eighty-three feet, and
thirty-seven to the ceiling; and is lighted by thirty-six windows. A
portico, with a recess of eleven feet, occupies the immediate front,
supporting the pediment by two Corinthian pillars, and an equal number
of pilastres. Two rooms are set apart in connection with this
establishment, one for the accommodation of captains of vessels, and one
for that of sugar-brokers. On each side of the news-room are ranges of
offices, to which admission is obtained by corridors on the inner side.
Immediately over these, the third floor is arranged in the same manner.
The intention of the company, under whose auspices this exchange is
building, is, to furnish to the mercantile community a place solely for
the transaction of business, similar to Lloyd's of London. There are to
be no liquors sold on the premises. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> Gallier is the architect, and
builder, and the building and land cost $90,000.</p>

</div>

<h3>THE MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE</h3>

<p>Fronting on Royal street and Exchange Place, was erected by a joint
stock company in 1835-6, from the designs and under the superintendence
of Mr. Dakin, architect. Both fronts are of marble, in a plain and bold
style. The cost of the erection was $100,000.</p>

<h3>THE MERCHANTS' READING ROOM</h3>

<p>Entrance from Royal street and Exchange Place. This reading room
occupied a spacious apartment in the second story of the Merchants'
Exchange, and is under the patronage and control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> of the company
interested in that building. It is generally supplied with most of the
newspapers of the country, and has received a patronage quite equal to
the extent of its accommodations.</p>

<h3>THE NEW ORLEANS READING ROOMS</h3>

<p>Occupy the second story of a spacious building on the corner of Common
and St. Charles streets, opposite the Exchange and Verandah hotels. This
is an enterprise started upon the plan of Galignani's, in Paris, and
Lloyd's, in London&mdash;professing to supply the earliest commercial and
general information. The fixtures are arranged with a degree of neatness
and convenience that is extremely gratifying to the stranger, who has a
spare hour to devote to reading. Here he can peruse the latest papers,
not only from almost every section of the United States, but English,
French, German, Mexican, Irish, Scotch, and Colonial, together with all
the periodicals, to his heart's content. The merchant can see the prices
current from nearly every part of the world; arrivals and departures of
vessels and of travellers&mdash;sales of the great staples and merchandise
and their prices, and many such matters of interest to the business
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>In each parish, have heretofore been placed under the management of a
board of five administrators, who reported annually to the secretary of
state the condition of those under their direction. This system has been
adhered to, till very recently, in the first and third municipalities.
In the second a change took place in 1841, which has proved to be so
complete a revolution, is attended with such important results to this
large portion of the city, and so extended its influence even to the
neighboring parishes, that it is referred to with a degree of pleasure
which can only be surpassed by our pride in its success.</p>

<p>In accordance with an act of the legislature, approved the 14th of
February, 1841, authorizing the municipalities of New Orleans to
establish public schools, the authorities of the second municipality set
themselves at work with a will. They selected twelve of their
fellow-citizens as a board of directors for public schools, together
with a standing committee on public education, to whom were granted
almost unlimited powers.</p>

<p>Zealous of acquitting themselves with honor, they at once looked to the
fountain head, to New England, where the best schools in the country
existed, and secured the aid of Mr. J. A. Shaw, who was perfectly
conversant with all the improvements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> and placed this efficient
gentleman at the head of the department as superintendent. From a
despairing beginning, in less than one year, the prospect seemed to be
most cheering. Commencing with only thirteen children of each sex, it
increased, in two years, to ten hundred and sixty-one in actual
attendance&mdash;and nearly double that number enrolled.</p>

<p>Thus far these schools occupied rooms under the Methodist church in
Poydras street, and a new building, called the Washington school, on
Magazine, at the corner of Basin street; but since that, the undertaking
has been continually extending, until it was found necessary to erect
another structure, the Franklin school, on St. Charles street&mdash;all of
which are now scarcely sufficient to answer the increasing demand for
admission.</p>

<p>That, which at first was tested as an experiment, has proved to be a
successful enterprise, producing an example which promises to have a
beneficial influence over the southern method of education. It found
strong opposition and prejudice to contend against, but these have
subsided&mdash;and the children of the rich and the poor are seated side by
side, sharing advantages and striving intellectually&mdash;the only
distinction recognized among them&mdash;"teaching one, as well as informing
the other, that adventitious wealth confers no superiority over the
fortunate competitor, when engaged in a contest of the mind."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The third municipality school is under the charge of Mr. Geo. W. Harby.
All the branches of a good education are taught here in the English,
French and Spanish languages. Although this school is under excellent
discipline, and has all the advantages of a classical and gentlemanly
teacher, it still has labored under the old régime, and could have
educated double the number that have attended it. That nothing stands
still is as applicable to the intellectual as to the physical world.
Already the spirit of improvement, that has done so much for the second
municipality, is busy in the first and third&mdash;and though slowly, it is
as sure, eventually, to push its way into them as water is to find its
own level. Beside the public schools, there are many private seminaries
of a high order, and conducted by teachers of ability, where the
wealthy, who have objections to those above designated, may send their
children for instruction.</p>

<p>The education of youth is of the utmost importance to a
country&mdash;especially to one like this, that should be governed by the
intelligence of its citizens. The portals to learning should be thrown
wide open, equally to all&mdash;for upon knowledge is based the beautiful
temple of liberty. Tear away this foundation and the fair edifice must
fall. Cherish and support it, and freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> will become as permanent as
our rocks, as ever-lasting as our hills.</p>

<h3>PUBLIC SCHOOL LYCEUM AND SOCIETY LIBRARY</h3>

<p>The intention of this undertaking, is to establish a library for the
benefit of the juvenile class of the second municipality, by the
voluntary subscriptions and contributions of the scholars attached to
the public schools, and by private donations. To advance this important
object, the common council passed an ordinance organizing the
establishment, regulating and directing its proceedings, and tendering
liberal advantages to encourage success in its operations. When $5000
are subscribed they are pledged to furnish rooms to accommodate the
library&mdash;and, as soon as it amounts to $15,000, to purchase ground and
erect suitable buildings. It also provides that, at a certain period, a
chemical and philosophical apparatus shall be purchased, and lectures
delivered once a week, during eight months of the year, by the most
competent men in the country, on astronomy, geology, chemistry, natural
and moral philosophy, navigation, book-keeping, engineering, civil
architecture and design, and such other useful branches as may be
determined by the directors&mdash;who are the same as those of the public
schools, with the mayor, recorder and aldermen as <i>ex-officio</i> members.
The scholar paying twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> cents a month, or three dollars a year,
for three years, is constituted a life member, and for ever after may
have access to this excellent institution. Such has been the success of
this undertaking that a building will soon be provided, and very little
time will transpire before it will realize all the advantages that its
beginning promised. To Samuel J. Peters, Esq., particularly, is this
city indebted for introducing and maturing this measure&mdash;and for
generous presents, to many other citizens and strangers, who have not
permitted their names to come before the world.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The growing popularity of the "<i>People's Lyceum</i>," and of the "<i>Young
Men's Literary Association</i>," is noticed with no ordinary feelings of
gratification. These, commenced and continued by the young, fostered and
cherished by all&mdash;have become a cheering sight to the eye of the
christian, the patriot, and the philanthropist. Established upon
judicious principles, tending to give a wholesome direction and salutary
stimulus to the mind of their members, the moral influence may be deemed
of incalculable consequence to this growing metropolis. History and
science are the leading objects of their inquiry, facilitated and
encouraged by the delivery of lectures, affording not only instruction
but recreation&mdash;creating a taste for the rapid acquirement of
knowledge&mdash;giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> a new impulse to the intellectual powers, and to the
advancement of literature&mdash;all nobly contributing to the refinement and
happiness of mankind. These, and others in the course of being
established under the auspices of our most eloquent and learned
literati, the city may class among the brightest of her jewels.</p>

<h3>MEDICAL COLLEGE OF LOUISIANA</h3>

<p>This building is erected on a fine lot of ground, on the corner of
Common and Philippa streets, granted to the college by a recent act of
the legislature. It was designed by, and completed under the direction
of Mr. Dakin, architect, whose reputation is a guaranty for its taste
and elegance. The location is retired, and yet near all the public
buildings and thoroughfares. The faculty of this institution are
gentlemen of superior qualifications, enthusiastic in their zeal to give
it the first place among the kindred establishments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> the country. The
advantages of New Orleans, for acquiring a practical knowledge of
medicine and surgery, are superior to any city in the United States,
especially for the study of all diseases peculiar to a southern climate.
The facilities for prosecuting the study of anatomy and surgery are
unrivalled. The school is well furnished with models, plates, casts, and
every thing necessary for illustrations. The requisitions for graduation
are those adopted by the best colleges. With these advantages presented
to southern students, they will see the benefits resulting from an
institution built up among them, conducted by gentlemen acquainted by
experience with the wants of the country.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3>THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF PAINTINGS</h3>

<p>This establishment occupies rooms, expressly built for its
accommodation, at 13 St. Charles street, and was opened in 1844, under
the personal inspection of the proprietor, Mr. G. Cooke, who is himself
an artist of taste, and well known among the profession. The principal
object was, to form a rallying point for the exhibition of the works of
celebrated artists, both of foreign and American origin, and to dispose
of such as might please the fancy of the public, at a certain fixed
price. Here, visitors will have an opportunity of selecting copies and
originals from a quarter that may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> relied upon, works both of the old
masters, and of the best of the modern schools.</p>

<p>The proprietor is under obligations to a number of the gentlemen of this
city, connoisseurs of painting, for the exhibition of some of the most
prominent pieces. From R. D. Shepherd, Esq., he has a picture by
Rothmel, representing De Soto discovering the Mississippi. If this
artist should leave no other work, his reputation, as a genius of no
ordinary ability, will remain as durable as the canvas on which he has
portrayed the Spaniard and the "Father of Waters."</p>

<p>From James Robb, Esq., whose magnificent collection of modern paintings
is better known in other cities than our own, the gallery has received
its richest treasures, and most valuable contributions. The chef
d'&oelig;uvre is from the pencil of a native artist now at Rome, Leutze;
and illustrates this sentence in our Lord's prayer&mdash;"deliver us from
evil." To speak of this gem in terms equal to its merits, would place it
immeasurably above the estimation of the age in which we live. Aware
that it may be considered presumption to compare living genius with the
justly venerated names of the immortal dead, whose works, on account of
their antiquity and intrinsic worth, are doubly valued&mdash;yet, at the risk
of losing our little reputation in such matters, we venture the
assertion that this picture of Leutze's will compare with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> the most
beautiful of the Italian school, and is excelled by none in America, not
excepting those of our lamented and talented Alston. This picture alone
would make any gallery in Europe attractive, and the public are greatly
indebted to Mr. Robb for the opportunity he has afforded them of seeing
not only this, but many other brilliant productions.</p>

<p>Here, also, is a landscape of no ordinary excellence, by Boddington, an
English artist, who has most successfully represented one of his native
scenes, in a style of handling peculiarly true and free. Here may be
seen four of Doughty's best landscapes, and several fine specimens from
the pencils of Cole and Chapman. The portrait of Col. David Crocket, as
large as life, in his forest costume, by Chapman, and two large altar
pieces, copied from celebrated works in the Vatican&mdash;The Entombing of
Christ, after Corregio&mdash;and The Crucifixion of St. Peter, after
Guido&mdash;comprise a portion of the more recent additions to the gallery.</p>

<p>Among the most attractive performances, are The Wreck of the Medusa, The
Roman Forum, and a Sketch of Rome&mdash;from the pencil of the proprietor.
The first of these is very much admired&mdash;but, to the classical visitor,
the last two are far more fascinating; calling up, as they do, with all
their endearing associations, our happy school-day remembrances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Much more might be said respecting this establishment, but the brevity
of these pages will not permit an indulgence of our wishes in a more
minute detail.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It is probably the general impression of strangers, suggested by the
limited number and extent of the public galleries of paintings in this
city, that there is, among us, an entire deficiency of a proper taste
for the fine arts. And we may, ourselves, inadvertently have contributed
to such an impression, by representing our citizens as exclusively
absorbed in commercial pursuits. It must be received, however, with many
abatements. We have our artists, and not a few of them, who are highly
talented, and deservedly patronised.</p>

<p>There are choice collections of paintings in the possession of several
private gentlemen, other than those already alluded to; among which are
many valuable productions, not only of the modern but ancient masters,
purchased at enormous prices.</p>

<p>Among others, those owned by our highly esteemed fellow-citizens, Glendy
Burke, H. R. W. Hill, and Joseph M. Kennedy, Esqs., are well worth a
visit of the connoisseur and admirer of fine specimens of the arts, to
which the known courtesy of the proprietors will cheerfully afford ready
access. The only original painting of the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Wilkie in this
country, is in the splendid collection of Mr. Burke.</p>

<p>Several fine specimens of original statues are in the possession of
James Dick, and John Hagan, Esqs., which are not excelled by any
collection in this country.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h3>THE PRESS</h3>

<div class="center">
"What is it but a map of busy life,<br />
Its fluctuations, and its vast concerns?"<br />
</div>

<p>The diurnal press of this country, is not only a mighty political
engine, but one of the utmost importance in a commercial and literary
point of view. Its increase, within a few years past, like its extending
liberty, is without a parallel, and almost beyond belief. Junius, in his
peculiar manner, observes, that "they who conceive that our newspapers
are no restraint upon bad men, or impediment to the execution of bad
measures, know nothing of this country." The force of this remark
applies nowhere better than to the Press of the United States.</p>

<p>Every enlightened American, who loves the constitution of his country,
and correctly estimates its lofty principles, will lend his aid to
preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> these invaluable privileges from the violation of power on the
one hand, and the equally injurious outrages of popular licentiousness
on the other.</p>

<p>The press of this city comes in for a portion of the credit that is
attached to that of the country&mdash;more particularly for its elaborate
commercial details and general literature. To embody the spirit of the
age; to relieve the grave by the gay; and to embellish the useful by the
amusing, is its daily task. The choicest of home and foreign literature
is found in the leading issues from the New Orleans press. It is equally
interesting to the merchant and the general reader; and it preserves,
above all its cotemporaries of other cities, a self-respect that does
infinite credit to the gentlemen to whose hands the important trust is
confided.</p>

<p>There are eight daily papers published in New Orleans&mdash;three of which
may be rated as of the "mammoth" size; the other five are smaller, but
of sufficient dimensions to furnish the ordinary news of the day. They
are as follows:</p>

<p>The Louisiana Courier is the only evening paper of the city, and is
published in French and English. This is the pioneer, before referred to
in this work, under the name of "La Moniteur." The Bee, also in French
and English, and the Commercial Bulletin, in English, make up the three
mammoth sheets. The Picayune, the Tropic, the Jeffersonian Republican,
the Native American,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> and the New Orleans Times, are all in English. The
New Orleans Price Current is a very useful publication, issued twice a
week.</p>

<p>In addition to these, the Catholics and Protestants each have their
weekly Journals, and the Medical faculty their bi-monthly Periodicals,
edited by the most prominent members of the profession, and devoted to
Medicine, and Collateral Sciences. They are intended to bring forth the
industry and talents of the profession in the South, and to furnish the
most recent information of its progress generally.</p>

<p>The subject of Organic Chemistry is that to which, at the present day,
the eyes of all thinking members of the profession are directed, and
upon which their hope of progress mainly depends,&mdash;the relations of
chemical action to the functions of organized matter, the application of
chemistry to physiology and pathology, are to be treated of as fully as
present knowledge extends.</p>

<p>Such contributions to the noble science, in which these gentlemen have
long been successful laborers, cannot fail to be properly estimated
throughout the scientific world.</p>

<h2><a name="AMUSEMENTS" id="AMUSEMENTS"></a>AMUSEMENTS</h2>


<p>At the commencement of the holidays, the city begins to put on a gay
aspect. Visitors, from all parts of the habitable globe, have arrived,
either on business or pleasure. A general round of balls, masquerades,
soirées and parties begin, and are continued without intermission during
the season. Theatres and operas, with their <i>stars</i> and <i>prima donnas</i>,
circuses and menageries, bell-ringers and serenaders, are in full
success&mdash;and New Orleans, filled with every description of amusement,
from the top of the drama down to Judy and Punch. Strangers are
surprised and delighted at the splendor that is carried out in these
circles of pleasure. Our present object, however, is merely to describe
the most conspicuous places of public resort.</p>

<h3>ORLEANS THEATRE</h3>

<p>The site of this building was occupied by an edifice erected for
dramatic performances in 1813, somewhat on the plan of the one now
existing. This, which was built by a joint stock company, was burnt to
the ground in 1816. Mr. John Davis afterwards became the sole
proprietor, and began the erection of the present theatre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i179.jpg" width="500" height="371" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The building was opened by the first dramatic corps, ever in Louisiana
directly from France, in November, 1819. The total cost of the edifice
was about $180,000. The lower story is of the Roman Doric order,
certainly not a pure specimen. The upper is what may be called the
Corinthian composite. The interior and scenic arrangements of the house
are excellent for seeing and hearing, having a pit, or parquette, quite
elevated and commodious, with grated boxes at the side for persons in
mourning; two tiers of boxes, and one of galleries above; the whole
being of such a form as to afford the greatest accommodation to the
spectators.</p>

<p>Nothing can exceed the decorum of the audience, except the brilliancy of
the dress circle, which, on certain occasions, is completely filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
with the beautiful ladies of our city, in full evening costume. The
performances are in the French language, and the stock company always
respectable. The orchestra is excellent. Melodramas and operas are
perfectly got up at this house. The strict adherence to nature and
history, in costume and manners, will never fail to please the man of
taste who visits the Orleans theatre.</p>

<h3>THE NEW ST. CHARLES THEATRE</h3>

<p>Like the ph&oelig;nix, literally arose from the ashes of its predecessor.
The first house was erected by the sole exertions of James H. Caldwell,
Esq., in 1835, at the cost of $250,000, exclusive of the ground. It
occupied one hundred and twenty-nine feet front by one hundred and
eighty-six deep, and was seventy-six high. It held four thousand people,
and was the fourth in size in the world&mdash;one at St. Petersburg, in
Russia, another at Pescala, in Milan, and the third at San Carlos, in
Naples, were those only which excelled it in size. It was destroyed by
fire in 1842. That structure was styled "the Temple of the Drama," and
the city had good reason to be proud of such an ornament.</p>

<p>The present building has a front of seventy-nine feet on St. Charles
street, extends back one hundred and forty-nine, and is fifty-three
high.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> The main entrance and front wall are remains of the former
establishment; which, from the substantial workmanship, resisted the
conflagration so effectually as to be made available the second time.
Passing this memento, the spectator finds himself in the vestibule,
thirty-four by twenty-three feet, from which a double flight of
geometrically formed stairs ascend to the first tier. Here the pit is
seen in a semi-circular shape. The centre box is but fifty-one feet from
the foot lights, which brings the audience within a convenient distance
of the stage. The depth of the front boxes to the rear is twenty-one
feet. The proscenium presents an elevation of thirty-nine feet in the
clear, by fifty in width. The upper circles of boxes possess the like
advantage of the first, in respect to a distinct view of the
performances.</p>

<p>The fronts of the boxes consist of an open balustrade, producing a
novel, and agreeable effect. The dome is ornamented with sunken panels,
suitably embellished with emblematic devices. A golden-fringed national
drapery falls from the proscenium, displaying an ingeniously contrived
allegory in the centre. Four columns sustain an ornamented entablature
above, composed of a mixed style of architecture, and copied after those
of the celebrated temple of Benares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE AMERICAN THEATRE</h3>

<p>Burnt on the 30th of July, 1842, was rebuilt and reopened on the 5th of
December following, at a cost of $28,000. The building is ninety by one
hundred and fifty feet, and sufficiently elevated for all the purposes
of the drama, but irregular in its altitude. The depth of the stage is
sixty feet, and the width of the proscenium thirty-eight. The house will
accommodate over fifteen hundred persons. It stands near Lafayette
square, on Poydras street; and, from its isolated position, presents
quite an imposing appearance.</p>

<h3>THE CIRCUS</h3>

<p>The company have fitted up the old depôt of the Carrolton rail-road,
situated on the corner of Poydras and Baronne streets, as a place for
exhibiting feats of horsemanship. As the buildings possess no especial
interest beyond these performances, they require no particular
description&mdash;but as this amusement has an attraction for almost every
class of visitors, not to have referred to it might have been deemed an
inexcusable oversight. There is a stage attached to this establishment;
and farces and the ballet relieve the monotony of the sports of the
ring.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PUBLIC_SQUARES" id="THE_PUBLIC_SQUARES"></a>THE PUBLIC SQUARES</h2>


<p>Although the public squares in New Orleans are neither numerous, nor
upon a very extended scale, they are located with good taste, and are
exceedingly convenient. The centres of Canal, Esplanade, Rampart and
Basin streets have a very considerable space set apart for
embellishments. Shrubbery, and other ornaments, are in progress, and
they already begin to assume a beauty that does much credit to the city
authorities. Nothing is more conducive to health than these pleasant
resorts for wholesome exercise. Here the toil-worn citizen, the wearied
scholar, and the confined artizan, may breathe the fresh air, enjoy a
delightful morning or evening promenade, and catch an imaginary
enjoyment, in miniature, of the blessed country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washington Square</span> is in the third municipality; is bounded by the
Elysian Fields, Great-Men's, Casa Calvo and Frenchmen streets.&mdash;Though
admirably situated, owing to the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> it stands from the denser
portion of the city, it has not yet received those attentions which, at
some future day, will render it a beautiful promenade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place d'Armes</span>, or <i>Parade Square</i>, is still more prominent, and is
embellished with fine trees; but, as it is in the centre of the first
municipality, with the public buildings on one front and the levee on
the other, it is a matter of surprise that it has not been improved in a
style worthy of the inhabitants; who, certainly are capable of
appreciating the advantages of such delightful grounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Circus Place</span> is below Rampart street, with St. Claude on the rear, and
St. Ann and St. Peter streets on its sides. This is the square once
known as <i>Congo Park</i>; and is the place where the negroes, in olden
times, were accustomed to meet to while away the cares of servitude.
Many an old inhabitant can remember when he beheld these thoughtless
beings dancing "Old Virginia never tire," or some other favorite air,
with such a hearty gusto, upon the green sward, that the very ground
trembled beneath their feet. Though the loud laugh, and the
unsophisticated break-down, and double-shuffle of these primitive days
have ceased, the spot yet remains, with all its reminiscences, as
original as ever, with its capabilities of improvement still unimpaired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lafayette Square</span> is decidedly the handsomest in the city. It is in the
second municipality, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> has St. Charles and Camp streets in front and
rear, and several public buildings in its immediate neighborhood. It has
a handsome and substantial iron railing around it, based upon well laid
blocks of granite; is well laid off in regular walks, and is ornamented
with beautiful and rare shrubbery, set out with geometrical accuracy on
a raised surface, calculated to make it dry and pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annunciation Square</span>, in the same municipality, is the largest, and,
consequently, may some day become the most elegant in the city. Orange
and Race streets are on its front and rear&mdash;and facing are some very
tasteful private residences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tivoli Circle</span>, as its name would imply, is a circular piece of land laid
off as a public ground in Nyade, at the head of St. Charles street, and
is intended to be ornamented.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_OLDEN_TIME" id="THE_OLDEN_TIME"></a>THE OLDEN TIME</h2>


<p>Antiquity! the olden time! the hoary, venerable past! there is something
sacred and soul subduing in the very sound of the words. Like the dying
echo of the last tones of the departed, it is full of hallowed memories,
and cherished associations, that haunt the inner chambers of the
imagination, and linger with a mournful tenderness about the better
feelings of the heart.</p>

<p>But what have <i>we</i> to do with Antiquity! They of the old World, who were
grey with time and tottering with decay when, but yesterday, they saw us
spring into being, laugh at our sometime boast of Antiquity; and well
they may, for it is hardly as well substantiated as that of the simple
boy who conceived himself the oldest person in the world, because he
could not remember when he was born. Yet even we, in the New World, we,
of its second or third generation, whose fathers were present at its
birth and baptism, even <i>we</i> begin to talk gravely of the olden time,
and to sigh and look sad over the melancholy grandeur of the past!</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Well, be it so. In these stirring times, an age is shorter, and sooner
achieved, than in those of "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>sluggish eld." Time is measured by
events, and not by revolutions of the sun&mdash;by the progress of the mind,
not by the slow sifting sands of the hour glass, and the amazing
precocity of these latter days makes many ages out of a single century.</p>

<p>But what a vandal spirit is innovation! what a ruthless destroyer is
this boasted modern improvement! It sweeps over the land with the energy
of a new creation, demolishing and scattering whatever lies in its way,
for the mere pleasure of reproducing it in a new and better form. It
removes the ancient land marks, obliterates the last traces of ancient
power and grandeur, levels mountains, fills up valleys, turns the
courses of rivers, and makes all things bend to its iron will.</p>

<p>It works such rapid and magical changes in its headlong career, that few
of us are able to point out what <i>has been</i>, or to predict with
certainty what <i>will be</i> to morrow. Let us cherish then, with deeper
veneration, the few relics that remain of the days of our fathers. Let
us reverence Antiquity such as it is. Let the street commissioner, and
the <i>improver</i> of old estates&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem1"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Spare that ancient house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touch not a single brick&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is almost alone in its sombre dignity, in the midst of younger and
gayer edifices, that have swept New Orleans <i>as it was</i>, into the shade
of oblivion. Antiquity&mdash;I mean, if I may be allowed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> Irish figure of
speech&mdash;modern Antiquity, her countenance grave with sorrow, with here
and there a furrow upon her yet ample brow, protests against the
desecration of all that <i>was</i> dear and sacred. Standing on the verge of
annihilation, with "one foot in the grave," and conscious that her days
are numbered, her dissolution nigh at hand, she commands, she implores
us to save one memento of the past, one legible souvenir of "the days of
auld lang syne." And here it is.</p>

<h3>THE OLD SPANISH BUILDING</h3>

<p>At the corner of Royal and St. Anne streets, is delineated in the above
engraving as it now stands&mdash;and long may it remain as a memorial of
other times.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago&mdash;which, comparatively would take us back three
centuries in any European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> city&mdash;thirty years ago, one might have seen
from that spot, then the centre of the city, long perspective
street-scenes of a similar character. <span class="smcap">Innovation</span> has now done her
work&mdash;has absolutely trodden the city of the last century under her
feet.</p>

<p>The Casa Blanca, at the corner of Bienville and Old Levee Streets, has
also escaped the general demolition. It was once the courtly residence
of Bienville, the first governor of Louisiana&mdash;the seat of power, and
the centre of wealth, beauty and fashion in the province. It is still on
its old foundation, standing "alone in its glory," and the spirit of
innovation has so far respected its ancient uses, that it is still a
treasury of wealth, and a conservatory of the <i>sweetness</i> of our favored
clime&mdash;a store house of sugar and molasses!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="EXCURSIONS" id="EXCURSIONS"></a>EXCURSIONS</h2>


<p>In consequence of the level surface of the country in the environs of
New Orleans, a great variety of scenery cannot be expected&mdash;yet, on the
northern shore of lake Pontchartrain, the ground is somewhat higher and
rolling, and affords very pleasant positions. Although not formed like
the prolific north and west, in hill and dale, cliffs and cascades,
alternately varying and beautifying the landscape, yet there are
charming rides and rambles in the neighborhood of this city, of which a
more minute account will be given under their respective heads, which
follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrolton</span>, a distance of six miles by the rail-road, is an exceedingly
pleasant resort. The line, for nearly a third of the way, passes through
the suburbs of the city, and is dotted on either side with beautiful
residences&mdash;the remainder passes through cultivated fields, pleasant
pastures, and delightful wood-lands. The road, like the country, is
perfectly level, and kept in the finest condition. At the end of the
route is situated the village; which is principally composed of
tastefully built cottages, constructed in every variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> architecture
that suited the individual fancy of the owner. Opposite the rail-road
depôt, is one of the handsomest and most extensive public gardens, that
is to be found in the vicinity of New Orleans. A race course is near by;
and the strolls around are quite cheering to those who fly from the
turmoil and dust of the metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The shell road</span> of the Canal and Banking Company, affords an agreeable
ride to lake Pontchartrain, also a distance of six miles. The highway
runs on the margin of the canal, and is not excelled by any road in the
United States. It is the great resort for every species of pleasure
vehicle that the city furnishes; and here may be seen, on an afternoon,
all grades of society, from the gay sportsman, mounted on his fast
trotter, to the sober citizen, who sallies forth on his ambling poney,
all of whom appear to realize an equal share of enjoyment. A line of
comfortably arranged barges also ply on the canal from the lake, at
which place a convenient hotel is established. Half way on this road,
between the city and the lake, is the highly celebrated Metairie race
track.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The pontchartrain rail-road</span>, runs to the lake from which it derives its
name, from the head of Elysian Fields street, a distance of five miles.
It is a very pretty ride. This route communicates with the great
northern mail line, which goes by the way of Mobile&mdash;and all the
steamboats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> that traverse the lakes to the various villages and
landings that surround it, make this their general starting point. From
here, a passage is obtained to Biloxi, which, the reader will recollect,
was the first spot settled by the French in this portion of the world;
and, from that circumstance, will naturally excite the curiosity of the
intelligent wayfarer. At the termination of this rail-road is a
first-rate hotel for the accommodation of visitors. Here is good
bathing, fishing and shooting; and, beneath the shade of the trees, the
breeze from the water is delightfully refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The mexican gulf rail-road</span>, runs from Elysian Fields street, on Good
Children street, towards Lake Borgne. There are twenty eight miles of
this road now in operation. When finished, it will afford considerable
facilities to commerce, besides great benefit to the citizens, conveying
them, in about one and a half hours, to the refreshing breeze of the
ocean&mdash;where fish, oysters and game may be found in abundance. No doubt
it will compete with the most favored watering places of Bay St. Louis,
Pass Christian, Biloxi, &amp;c. It will also be a great accommodation to the
planters in the neighborhood&mdash;who already, so far as it goes, have given
it good encouragement. This road has recently been purchased of the
State, by A. Gordon and Co., who, availing themselves of about 22 miles
of the Nashville rail-road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> iron, are bringing this work to a rapid
completion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The road of bayou st. john</span>, which follows the sinuosities of that
stream, and reaches lake Pontchartrain at the site of the old fort St.
John, after travelling the distance of about six miles, presents a very
pleasant drive. Returning by the new Shell road before mentioned, it
varies the route without adding much to the distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macdonough</span> stands on the banks of the river opposite to New Orleans; and
the crossing, in the hottest weather, is generally accompanied by a
slight breeze, rendered cool and pleasant by the mighty current of the
river, which comes from the icy springs of the Alleghanies and the Rocky
mountains. The village, of itself, possesses no great beauty&mdash;but the
country, the beautiful country is all around&mdash;and the noise and
confusion of the city no longer annoy you. The great attraction at this
spot is in visiting the United States marine hospital, one of the
handsomest structures in Louisiana, which stands a little above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Algiers</span> adjoins, and seems a part of Macdonough. This is the great
work-shop of New Orleans, for the building and repairing of vessels. It
has its dry docks, and other facilities for the most extensive
operations. In business times, it presents a scene of activity that is
seldom observed in any other part of these regions, and reminds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> one of
the bustling and enterprise of the North. The period has been when
Algiers prescribed the law, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vi et armis</i>, to the city itself&mdash;but the
day and the disposition, have happily long since passed away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretna</span>, on the same shore, is nearly two miles further up the river, and
stands opposite Lafayette. The whole distance is spotted with
comfortable residences, principally inhabited by the owners of the
adjoining grounds, and the walk from Algiers to this village is very
gratifying to one partial to such exercise. There is a steamboat
constantly plying from here to the city, which affords a desirable
excursion of nearly three miles, touching at Lafayette in its passage
each way. The village has a rural appearance, is regularly laid out, and
exhibits some neat tenements. The forest approaches quite near; and, the
idea that one may so easily lose himself in the neighboring woods, gives
to the place a touch of romance which only the denizens of a crowded
city know how to appreciate. From the great number of cattle observed
along the shore, it would seem as if there was no necessity of diluting
the milk for the New Orleans market, unless the milkmen be tea-total
temperance men, and take this method to introduce the inhabitants
gradually to a taste for water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The race courses.</span> There are three of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> in the vicinity of this
city. The <i>Louisiana</i>, near lake Pontchartrain; the <i>Metairie</i>, near the
Shell road; and the one at Carrolton. These are as well patronised as
any in the country, and, in the racing season, the inhabitants of the
neighboring states, from a great distance, flock hither to participate
in the sports of the turf. Much praise has been bestowed upon the
arrangements on these occasions. Even here, as in many other countries,
the ladies, by their presence, have given them countenance and
encouragement&mdash;and the course usually is "gemmed by the rich beauty of
the sunny south."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The battle ground</span>, (formerly known as "the Plains of Chalmette,") the
very naming of which causes the bosom of an American to swell with
patriotic pride, lies five miles below the city. It may be approached
either by the Grand Gulf rail-road, or by a good highway along the
levee, the new Convent and United States barracks being within full
view. But first it may be necessary to look briefly at the historical
facts which give celebrity to the spot.</p>

<p>Early in December, 1814, the British approached New Orleans, about 8000
strong, by the way of the lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain. Their passage
into the lake was opposed by a squadron of gun-boats under Lieut. Jones.
After a spirited conflict, in which the killed (500) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> the wounded of
the enemy exceeded the whole American force, he was compelled to
surrender to superior numbers.</p>

<p>On the 21st of Dec. four thousand militia arrived from Kentucky and
Tennessee, under General Jackson. On the 22nd, the enemy having
previously landed, took a position near the Mississippi, eight miles
below the city. On the evening of the 23d, the Americans made a furious
attack upon their camp, and threw them into disorder, with five hundred
of their men killed. The enemy rallied; and Gen. Jackson withdrew his
troops, and fortified a strong position six miles below the city,
supported by batteries on the west side of the river. Here he was
unsuccessfully assailed on the 28th of Dec. and 1st of Jan., the enemy
losing two hundred to three hundred men. In the mean time both armies
received reinforcements.</p>

<p>The decisive battle was fought on the 8th day of Jan. 1815. The American
right was on the river, running in a right angle to the wood. A redoubt
was raised (which is still visible) strengthened by bales of cotton
along the whole line. The enemy were about a half mile lower down, on a
parallel line, their head quarters resting on the river, near three
large oaks which still mark the spot. The scene is distinct, and this is
<i>the battle ground</i>.</p>

<p>The British commenced the assault at day light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> As they approached the
works, sixty deep, many were killed by grape shot; but, when they came
within musket range, a destructive stream of fire burst forth from the
American lines. Our troops were placed in two ranks, the rear loading
while the front fired, thus pouring an incessant peal&mdash;which, from
Kentucky and Tennessee riflemen, was most deadly. While leading on the
troops of the enemy, Gen. Pakenham, the chief in command, was killed;
Gen. Gibbs, the second in command, was wounded mortally; and Gen. Keene
severely. Without officers to direct them, the troops halted, fell back,
and soon fled in confusion to their camp. In a little over an hour, two
thousand out of eight thousand veterans lay dead upon the field, while
the Americans had but seven killed and six wounded&mdash;a disproportion
unparalleled in the history of warfare. Gen. Lambert, upon whom the
command then devolved, after one more unsuccessful attempt to assault,
availed himself of a truce of twenty-four hours to bury the dead, made
good his retreat&mdash;which Gen. Jackson felt no disposition to molest, as
he was resolved to hazard none of his advantages. Thus was New Orleans
saved from the hands of an invading enemy whose War cry was&mdash;"Beauty and
Booty."</p>

<p>The British lost during the month they were in Louisiana, more than
three thousand three hundred and fifty in killed, while the loss of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Americans was not two hundred. The wounded of the enemy must have been
much less, on account of the sure aim of the backwoodsmen. The greater
portion of our army were plain honest farmers&mdash;who knew nothing of
battle&mdash;they heard that their country was in danger&mdash;the country which
gave a home to them, and their children, and they flew to its
defence,&mdash;drove the invaders from their shores, and then returned to
their homes to till the ground.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of surprise&mdash;though the battle is without a parallel
in the history of the world&mdash;that even "invincibles," were so dreadfully
routed by undisciplined backwoodsmen defending their native soil, with
their wives and children behind them.</p>

<p>A jaunt to these grounds is a sort of pilgrimage, that no stranger will,
that no citizen can neglect. Not to have seen the field of this great
victory, would be a reflection upon the taste, not to say the patriotism
of any who should visit our city. The ground it is true, presents few
memorials to remind the patriotic visitor of the deadly strife. There is
no proud monument, towering to the sky, to mark the place where the
great victory was won. But he beholds the consequences wherever he turns
his eye, and he feels them&mdash;deeply feels them in every throb of his
heart. Those born upon the soil, and those who participated in the
struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> have reason to be proud of the spot, and to cherish the
memory of that eventful day. If there is no lofty structure of granite
or marble, to perpetuate the glorious achievement, it has a holier, a
more enduring memorial in the heart of every true American, which
thrills with lofty pride at every allusion to it, as did the ancient
Greek at the name of Marathon, or the Spartan at that of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>The facilities which this metropolis affords for
reaching any accessible portion of the world, particularly
all sections of the union, are not excelled.
Steam and sailing ships of the first class,
hold commercial intercourse with almost every
nation. Steamboats, with accommodations equal
to the best regulated hotels, are plying through
every river and bayou. Four to five thousand
miles can be achieved, in those floating palaces,
with perfect ease, and comparative safety.</p>

<p>The principal routes between the north and the
south are here given, as also the intermediate
places, together with those inland most frequented
by the traveller and the man of business, and the
distances carefully noted as they diverge, in their
various directions. Beside the four annexed routes
to New York, there are several that lead to favorite
watering places, and other points attractive
to travellers of leisure, which it would be quite
impracticable to lay down in a work of this kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
They can always obtain information of these
resorts, from intelligent companions on the road,
that will prevent their deviating much from the
point they wish to attain. The distances on the
river have been corrected agreeably to the latest
survey. The other routes conform to the most

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Many of the preceding statements are the result of an
extensive personal observation; for others, the work is indebted to
McCulloch, a compilation of considerable value, but, unfortunately, not
always to be relied on as authority. In some points, he is glaringly
incorrect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The new constitution of Louisiana prescribes that the
legislature shall establish free schools throughout the state, appoint a
superintendent of education, and provide means for defraying the expense
by taxation. The proceeds from the sale of all public lands granted by
the United States, the estates of deceased persons escheating to the
state, as well as certain other named emoluments, are to remain a
perpetual fund, sacredly to be applied to the support of such schools. A
provision is also to be made for establishing a college in the city of
New Orleans, to be called <i>the University of Louisiana</i>, to consist of
four faculties, viz. law, medicine, the natural sciences and letters&mdash;of
which the Medical College of Louisiana, as now organized, is to
constitute the faculty of medicine. The legislature is to be under no
obligations to contribute to the support of this institution by
appropriations.</p></div>

<h4>Transcriber's Notes:</h4>
<p>Typographical errors in spelling and punctuation repaired; variant
spellings changed when there was a clear majority.</p>

<p>The following variant spellings were retained:
"depot" (used for New Orleans) and "depôt" (used for rail-road);
"moschetoes" and "mosquitoes"; "enquir" and "inquir" roots (used
equally); "Pittsburg" (Miss.) and "Pittsburgh" (Pa.); "Cleaveland"
(Ohio) (per Columbia Gazetteer of the World, this was the original
name, after its founder Moses Cleaveland); "Zimple" and "Zimpel";
"regime" and "régime."</p>

<p>Hyphenation variants changed to majority use (with priority on usage
in headings and text, over usage in index or tables); retained when
equal (wood-lands and woodlands, re-transferred and retransferred,
pre-eminence and preeminently). "steam-boat" and "steam boat" changed
to "steamboat" except on p. 27, where "Steam Boat" is used for the first
appearance of a new technology.</p>

<p>Punctuation after chapter and section headings, and illustration
captions (periods, commas, no punctuation) was inconsistent;
standardized to no punctuation. Brackets around "see Route"
references changed to more frequent parentheses.</p>

<p>P. 20, "Vandreuil" corrected to "Vaudreuil."</p>
<p>P. 73, Meteorological table has been split for better displaying (text only).</p>
<p>P. 84, "inexaustible" changed to "inexhaustible."</p>
<p>P. 103, "Diocess" retained; per Oxford English Dictionary (OED) correct for time period.</p>
<p>P. 147, "Tchapitoulas" corrected to "Tchoupitoulas."</p>
<p>P. 174, "cotemporaries" retained; per OED, this was a common period
variant for contemporaries.</p>
<p>P. 205, Route 4; "Tombigkbe" changed to "Tombigbee."</p>
<p>P. 206, Savannah. Original shows cumulative miles 2196. Transposition
repaired.</p>
<p>P. 206, Route 10 heading, "Ala." to more frequent "Al."</p>
<p>P. 213, index; originally left justified "Seven blocks" now indented
under "Fire consumes."</p>
<p>P. 222, index; originally left justified "Branch Bank" now indented under
"United States."</p>

<p>The following discrepancies in route tables were retained as shown in
the original:<br />
P. 202, Smithfield, "1" in original would add up to 1086 cumulative
(11 mile discrepancy).<br />
P. 203, Greenupsburg, "13" in original would add up to 1675
cumulative (1 mile discrepancy). Georgetown "7" and Beaver "13"
appear to be averaged, since each addition does not add up, but their
cumulative addition (20 miles from Welleville to Beaver) does add up.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
